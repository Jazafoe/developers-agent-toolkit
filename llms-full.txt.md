# Mastercard Cross-Border Services
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/index.md

## Overview {#overview}

Note: This documentation is for the developers and technical managers who want to integrate with Cross-Border Services to deliver a fund transfer solution. For program details, rules and further implementation guidance, contact your Mastercard representative.

Cross-Border Services is a global payment service that provides access to faster, transparent payments between Senders and Recipients through multiple channels and payout methods. Cross-Border Services provides:

* A technical system interface for Customers to initiate Transactions to approved Receiving Territories
* Wholesale and retail Foreign Exchange (FX) rates and fees
* Customer support to the Customer for Transaction, settlement, and reconciliation reporting
* Settlement services between the Customer and Mastercard
* For certain Customers, pricing and rate mechanisms to determine up-front pricing information for Senders

<br />

Supported customer payment transfer types include:

* Person to Person (P2P)
* Business to Person (B2P)
* Business to Business (B2B)
* Person to Business (P2B)

The [use cases](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/index.md) describe how Cross-Border Services APIs facilitate the supported transaction types.

## Who can use it {#who-can-use-it}

A financial institution or third party provider (who represents financial institution) that will connect to Cross-Border Services **directly** to initiate fund transfers for its customers.

## How it works {#how-it-works}

The Cross-Border Service APIs enable financial institutions and partners to build flexible solutions that support many different funds transfer and payment types via a single connection to Mastercard. For these transfers, an Originating Institution (such as an Acquirer or Issuer) acts on behalf of the Sender to send funds to a Receiving System, which holds the Recipient's account. Depending on the type of transfer, Senders and Recipients may include consumers, businesses, non-profit organizations, mobile money agents and cash out locations.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/HowItWorks1.png)
Note: The diagram above illustrates a Customer that is an Originating Institution sending funds on behalf of its Senders.

## Next steps {#next-steps}

1. Take a look at the [Use Cases](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/index.md) to understand how the Cross-Border Service APIs facilitate the supported transaction types.

2. Look at the [API Basics](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/index.md) to learn about the Mastercard environments and the required project keys.

3. When you are ready to use the APIs, see [Getting Started with the APIs](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/getting-started/index.md) for information on connecting to the Cross-Border Service APIs.

4. Use the [API Reference](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/index.md) information for the APIs you want to use, to see details of the fields and values relevant to the transaction types you are supporting.

5. Try out the [Tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md) if you need help on how to make API calls to the Cross-Border Service APIs in the Sandbox environment.

# Reference Application
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/ref-app/index.md

You may connect to the Mastercard Cross-Border Services APIs either using a **REST client**.
Below tutorials illustrates the available options to connect to the Cross-Border Service APIs in the Sandbox environment with OAuth1.0A and OAuth2.0:

| Authentication Mechanism |      Option       |            APIs             |                                                                                          Tutorials                                                                                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OAuth1.0A                | using REST client | All APIs                    | [Reference Application Tutorial using OAuth1.0A](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/ref-app/reference-app-tutorial/index.md)                               |
| OAuth2.0                 | using REST client | All APIs except Balance API | [Reference Tutorial for Request Token based OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/ref-app/oauth2-reference-app-tutorial-request-token/index.md)     |
| OAuth2.0                 | using REST client | Balance API                 | [Reference Tutorial for Authorization Code based OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/ref-app/oauth2-reference-app-tutorial-access-token/index.md) |

Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, you must connect using [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for Balance API and [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for all APIs (except Balance API) as the authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).  

You may look at [Getting Started with APIs using OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/getting-started-oauth2/index.md) for step by step instructions on how to setup with OAuth2.0.

These tutorials show how you could use the Cross-Border Service APIs, but they do not prescribe the design and interactions of your funds transfer solution; those aspects are for you to define.

## FAQs {#faqs}

The APIs are provided for financial institutions and organizations that are registered to be a Customer for Mastercard Cross-Border Services. The APIs enable a Customer to send funds transfer requests, to Mastercard, which have been initiated for its consumers or by a Mastercard-approved Transaction Originator with which it is partnered. Yes, all of our APIs are PCI compliant. Sandbox, Mastercard Test Facility (MTF), and Production. Sandbox has API stubs that return simulated, static responses. MTF is a production-like environment. See [Environments](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/environments/index.md). The Cross-Border Service APIs are RESTful APIs with OAuth security. For all environments (Sandbox, MTF and Production), your API requests must have an OAuth 1.0a Authorization Header for authentication. See [Getting Started with the APIs](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/getting-started/index.md). If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, you must connect using [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for Balance APIs and [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for all other APIs, as the authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). See [Getting Started with the APIs using OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/getting-started-oauth2/index.md). Yes. In addition to OAuth1.0 method of authentication, the API requests and success responses have encrypted payloads, providing an additional layer of security during transmission (API error responses are not encrypted). See [Getting Started with the APIs](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/getting-started/index.md) for OAUTH and See [Payload Encryption](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md) for details on Payload Encryption. If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK and connecting using [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for Balance APIs and [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for all other APIs as the authentication mechanism, payload encryption is required. See [Getting Started with the APIs using OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/getting-started-oauth2/index.md) for OAUTH and See [Payload Encryption](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md) for details on Payload Encryption. Yes, the Sandbox APIs are provided so that you can try the APIs quickly. They are API stubs that return simulated, static responses---you do not need to provide a proper `partnerId` value in your API requests (your proper ID will be provided to you when you register for Mastercard Cross-Border Services).   

To use the Sandbox APIs, you must create a Mastercard Developers account choosing the Mastercard Cross-Border Services API service, generate the Sandbox Signing Keys, and use the signing keys to generate OAuth1.0A Authorization Headers for your API requests. See [Getting Started with the APIs](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/getting-started/index.md). Currently, we don't support testing APIs in Sandbox using OAuth2.0 without registering for Mastercard Cross-Border Services. To start using the Cross-Border Service APIs, you create a Mastercard Developers account and then create a project choosing the Mastercard Cross-Border Services API. See [Getting Started with the APIs](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/getting-started/index.md). You may look at the detailed [Tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md) for steps on connecting to Mastercard Cross-Border Services. In an attempt to simplify the process, we have deprecated the generated SDKs and provided lightweight libraries for OAuth that you can use to implement your own Oauth header or generate your own SDK by using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/integrations) and the Mastercard libraries for authentication. For more details, see [Getting Started with the APIs](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/getting-started/index.md) For the complete list of error codes, see [Error Codes](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/response-error-codes/index.md)

## Tutorials {#tutorials}

You may connect to the Mastercard Cross-Border Services APIs either using by **generating a SDK**.
Below tutorials illustrates the available options to connect to the Cross-Border Service APIs in the Sandbox environment with OAuth1.0A and OAuth2.0:

| Authentication Mechanism |          Option          |            APIs             |                                                                                   Tutorials                                                                                    |

| OAuth2.0                 | using self-generated SDK | All APIs except Balance API | [API tutorial for request token based OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/oauth2-api-sdk-tutorial-request-token/index.md) |
| OAuth2.0                 | using self-generated SDK | Balance API                 | [API tutorial for access token based OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/oauth2-api-sdk-tutorial-access-token/index.md)   |

Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, you must connect using [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for Balance API and [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for all APIs (except Balance API) as the authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).  

You may look at [Getting Started with APIs using OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/getting-started-oauth2/index.md) for step by step instructions on how to setup with OAuth2.0.

These tutorials show how you could use the Cross-Border Service APIs, but they do not prescribe the design and interactions of your funds transfer solution; those aspects are for you to define.

To use these APIs, you create a Mastercard Developers project with the **Mastercard Cross-Border Services** API service and set up the project keys, which are used for authenticating API access and encrypting/decrypting the request and response payloads. For more information, see [Getting Started with the APIs](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/getting-started/index.md).  
Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, you must connect using [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for Balance APIs and [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for all APIs (except Balance API) as the authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). Please proceed to [Getting Started with APIs using OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/getting-started-oauth2/index.md) for step by step instructions on how to setup. Note: We reserve the right to add parameters to resource actions/services and to add new fields to resource representations returned in responses. These types of changes are considered backward compatible and will added without changing the API version. Applications consuming these resources should be written such that new fields appearing in returned resource representations will not cause errors. We reserve the right to truncate data, when required to comply with constraints of financial messages initiated through calls to the Cross-Border Service API. We will not modify the consumer data in storage, but will perform any required truncation when the financial message is constructed.

# API Security
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-security/index.md

## Authentication {#authentication}

To access Mastercard Cross-Border Services APIs, you will need to use [OAuth1.0A](https://developer.mastercard.com/platform/documentation/security-and-authentication/using-oauth-1a-to-access-mastercard-apis/) as an authentication mechanism.
Please see [Getting Started with APIs](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/getting-started/index.md) for step by step instructions on how to setup.
Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, you must use [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for Balance APIs [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for all other APIs (except Balance API) as the authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). Please proceed to [Getting Started with APIs using OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/getting-started-oauth2/index.md) for step by step instructions on how to setup.

## Payload Encryption {#payload-encryption}

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the payload sent by Mastercard.   

For more detailed information on payload **Encryption or Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)
Note: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK and using [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for Balance APIs and [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for all APIs (except Balance API) as the authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), encrypting the request payload is optional since there are other security measures adopted for OAuth2.0 flows.

## Project Keys {#project-keys}

The following diagram shows the project keys that are used for authentication and encryption for each environment.

Cross-Border Services can be implemented flexibly, so you can adapt it to your unique business needs. However, there are certain features and principles that we recommend being factored into your final designs. Including these Moments that Matter will help you provide the best experience for your customers.

## Transparency {#transparency}

#### Display the FX rate, transfer fees, and speed upfront {#display-the-fx-rate-transfer-fees-and-speed-upfront}

The cost of making a transfer greatly influences consumer decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to clearly display the exchange rate, fees, and speed at the beginning of the transfer process. This involves emphasizing the fee and speed associated with sending money to any of the endpoint options, and informing consumers about the FX rate and its validity. Additionally, keeping consumers updated on any changes in these parameters ensures they know exactly how much they will be charged.

## Flexibility and choice {#flexibility-and-choice}

#### Provide options to choose fee preferences {#provide-options-to-choose-fee-preferences}

Cross-Border Services provide the flexibility to submit a payment request with the fee borne either by the sender or recipient. Harness this capability by empowering the sender to choose who pays the fee, while also showing its impact on the total to be paid.

#### Show supported endpoints {#show-supported-endpoints}

Cross-Border Services support multiple endpoints such as bank account, digital wallet, card, and cash pickup. Specifically, highlight a transfer's estimated delivery time and fees when organizing account payment methods.

## Clarity {#clarity}

#### Provide clarity through payment tracking {#provide-clarity-through-payment-tracking}

After the payment is initiated, users want to know when it is processed. By offering real-time updates and a tracker with detailed status information, users can monitor their transactions, leading to greater satisfaction. Payment tracking provides clarity, reducing anxiety and offering peace of mind.

#### Notify when payment is complete {#notify-when-payment-is-complete}

Users need assurance that their money transfer is complete and received by the intended recipient. Keep users informed of their financial activities through timely notification and updates.

# HTTP Response Codes
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/response-error-codes/http-response-codes/index.md

Resource requests use HTTP response codes to provide a coarse grain indication of the result of each request. The most common expected response codes for the supported HTTP methods are as follows:

| Request Method |                                                                                                                 Common Response Codes                                                                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POST           | * 200 (OK) = Request completed successfully * 400 (BAD REQUEST) = General errors with request message * 402 (REQUEST FAILED) = Transfer declined * 409 (CONFLICT) = Errors with transaction reference ID * 500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR) = System error |
| GET            | * 200 (OK) = Request completed successfully * 400 (BAD REQUEST) = General errors with request message * 404 (NOT FOUND) = Supplied ID not found or invalid                                                                                            |

The following table includes more response codes that may be returned for requests. In the event of network or infrastructure issues, other response codes may be returned by the infrastructure.

|     HTTP Response Codes     |                                                                                                                                                                                  Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200 (OK)                    | The request was completed successfully.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 400 (BAD REQUEST)           | General error when the request could not be fulfilled due to errors such as validation errors or missing required data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)          | Missing or invalid authentication token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 402 (REQUEST FAILED)        | The transaction was declined. Parameters were valid but the request failed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 403 (FORBIDDEN)             | The user is not authorized to perform the operation or the resource is unavailable for some reason, such as time constraints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 404 (NOT FOUND)             | The requested resource is not found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 405 (METHOD NOT ALLOWED)    | The requested URL exists, but the requested HTTP method is not applicable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 409 (CONFLICT)              | A resource conflict would be caused by fulfilling the request, for example trying to create a duplicate transfer request using the same transaction reference ID as a previous transfer request.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 429 (TOO MANY REQUESTS)     | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ('rate limiting'). The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait before making a new request. This is a courtesy response. When the service is receiving a very large number of requests from a single party, the system may drop connections to minimize resource monopolization. |
| 500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR) | The Mastercard Cross-Border Service API server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. Requests resulting in a 500 response code will generally include the Send API Errors structure in the response.                                                                                                                            |
| 5XX (SERVER ERROR)          | Errors that occur in the network infrastructure between the client and Mastercard Cross-Border Service API server will typically result in a response code in the 500 range. These errors will never contain the Send API Errors structure in the response.                                                                                                                   |

# Cross-Border System Errors
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/response-error-codes/cross-border-system/index.md

If a transaction cannot be processed, an error will occur. The error can be for a specific service format issue, network connection or overall message format issue. An error response will also be returned in the event the receiving entity returns a response code denoting a transaction is not authorized. In these cases, the response code and response description will also be returned in the details element of the error response.

# Payment with Carded Rate
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/payment-with-carded-rate/index.md

Carded Rate is offered as an opt-in functionality to obtain the FX rates for all the currency pairs that you support, for a valid period of time. Once opted in for the service, carded rate can be obtained via following mechanism:

1. API ([FX Pull/ FX Push](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/carded-rate-api/index.md)) based delivery

2. File based delivery

A carded rate include the dealable FX rate, rate ID, effective time, as well as other information for the currency pair. The Carded Rate Id for the desired currency pair can be sent within a payment transaction request to avail the provided FX rate, while the carded rate is valid. For the complete list of supported transaction types, see [Use Cases.](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/index.md)  

Ask your Mastercard Representative for more information on how to opt-in for the carded rate service and choose the best suitable delivery mechanism.

This payment option is mainly for the Customer Managed Sender Pricing (CMSP) Model. Learn more about the [Pricing Model](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/pricing-model/index.md).
Note: Unlike single quote, carded rate once obtained can be used across multiple transactions as long as the rate Id is valid.

Payment with Carded Rate can be achieved in three different ways:

## 1. Forward Payment (fees included) with carded rate: {#1-forward-payment-fees-included-with-carded-rate}

With this type, the sender specifies the Sending amount and currency for a payment including any applicable service fees and the amount received by recipient in the receiver currency is calculated.

As an example, below sequence shows a forward payment of 100 USD to Phillippines including the service fees with a carded rate obtained via FX pull API.  

**Note**: Carded rate can be also obtained using the FX Push API or file based approach.
Diagram send-fwd-with-carded-rate-fees-sequence

## 2. Forward Payment (fees not included) with carded rate {#2-forward-payment-fees-not-included-with-carded-rate}

The sender specifies the Sending amount and currency for a payment and Mastercard calculates the the amount received by the end recipient and also the amount charged to the sender with the service fees applied on top of the request send amount.

As an example, below sequence shows a forward payment transaction of 100 USD to Phillippines as and the service fees applied on top of the sending amount; with a carded rate obtained via FX pull API.  

**Note**: Carded rate can be also obtained using the FX Push API or file based approach.
Diagram send-fwd-with-carded-rate-wo-fees-sequence

## 3. Reverse Payment with carded rate {#3-reverse-payment-with-carded-rate}

With this type, the receiving amount in receiver currency is specified by the sender and the total amount charged to the sender is calculated; with a carded rate obtained via API or file approach.

As an example, below sequence shows a payment transaction of 5000 PHP as a reverse payment based on the carded rate obtained via FX pull API.  

**Note**: Carded rate can be also obtained using the FX Push API or file based approach.
Diagram send-rvs-with-carded-rate-sequence

### APIs that you will use for this payment model: {#apis-that-you-will-use-for-this-payment-model}

1. [FX Rate Push / FX Rate Pull API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/carded-rate-api/index.md) to obtain the carded rate.
2. [Payment API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/payment-api/index.md) POST request to submit a payment transaction to transfer funds to the cross border recipient (by providing the carded rate Id obtained in the FX Rate Push/ Pull API response).

### Some of the other APIs that are available as added functionality are: {#some-of-the-other-apis-that-are-available-as-added-functionality-are}

1. [Retrieve Payment API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/retrieve-payment-api/index.md) GET request to retrieve a payment transaction that was previously submitted.
2. [Status Change API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/status-change-api/index.md) POST request to get an update on the status change of the transaction that was previously submitted.
3. [Cancel Payment API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/cancel-payment-api/index.md) POST request to cancel a PENDING payment transaction that was previously submitted.

Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, please proceed to [Payment API Specifications for EU](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-payment-api/index.md) and [Payment API Specification for UK](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-payment-api/index.md) respectively to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based on Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

You can use this API to submit a payment transaction to transfer fund to a cross-border recipient.
If you opt-in for quote confirmation services, remember to confirm the quote before initiating the payment request.

Look at the [Payment](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/index.md) use cases for details on how to use the payment API for a cross border fund transfer solution.

## Environment Domains {#environment-domains}

* Sandbox/MTF
* Production

```Sandbox/MTF
https://sandbox.api.mastercard.com/send/v1/partners/{partner-id}/crossborder/payment
```

```Production
https://api.mastercard.com/send/v1/partners/{partner-id}/crossborder/payment
```

Note: **Sandbox** and **MTF** environments share the same url but are differentiated by partner id.

## API {#api}

[**Open Specification**](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/cross-border-swagger.yaml)

Alternatively, here is a tabular view of the request/ response parameter:
[Payment_Specifications.pdf](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Payment_Specifications.pdf) (1MB)   


API Reference: `GET /send/v1/partners/{partner-id}/crossborder/payment`

Note: In order to provide ease of processing and to avoid any potential keying errors, when a Quote is utilized and the Quote Proposal ID information is provided for payment initiation, the quote transaction details (sending/receiving accounts, amounts, currencies, etc.) are used to fill the payment request.

* **Formats supported** : XML/ JSON   
* **HTTP Version**: 1.0/ 1.1
* **Required HTTP header parameters** :   
  content-type : Format of the inbound content being submitted. example: application/json   
  content-length: Length of the inbound content body in octets.   
  Accept: Format of the expected response must be provided in this header field. Example - application/json

## API Convention {#api-convention}

Take a look at the [API Conventions](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-conventions/index.md) for general guidelines.

## Payload Encryption {#payload-encryption}

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the payload sent by  
Mastercard.   

For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)

## Sandbox Testing {#sandbox-testing}

You can make API calls to the Sandbox server from your application code using the [tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md), which involves creating a Mastercard Developers project and using the Sandbox keys to generate the required Authorization Header.
Tip: During the onboarding process, Mastercard will assign a registered partner ID to test in the higher environments (MTF Test and Production). This partner ID will not be able to access the sandbox environment, but the customer can still access sandbox by using the non-registered partner ID.  
Any correctly formatted partner ID can be used in the sandbox. As a best practice, use the first 15 digits of your institution's name (alphanumeric and/or special characters, no spaces) as the Partner_ID.   
For testing in sandbox, please use unique transaction_reference on each run. Note: The sandbox does not return parameters unique to a specific Customer; such as pricing, limits, and corridor-specific data requirements, but allows you to test general call structure and responses outside of the production environment. After sandbox testing is completed, Customers meeting the eligibility requirements will be assigned a project manager to do integrated testing in the test environment that has been configured to include requested receiving corridors, current foreign exchange rates, and fixed and variable fees specific to the Customer.

### Sandbox Test cases {#sandbox-test-cases}

The Sandbox server returns simulated, static responses. You can use the following test cases to produce specific responses in sandbox.

Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, you must connect using [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for Balance APIs and [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for all APIs (except Balance API) as the authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).   
Please proceed to [the Reference Tutorial for Authorization Code based OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/ref-app/oauth2-reference-app-tutorial-access-token/index.md) and [Reference Tutorial for Request Token based OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/ref-app/oauth2-reference-app-tutorial-request-token/index.md) to learn about connecting to Mastercard Cross-Border Services APIs.

## Introduction {#introduction}

This tutorial demonstrates how a simple web application can use the Cross-Border Service APIs to execute and manage the payment transactions. This includes making API calls with the use of Rest client to the following Cross-Border Service APIs in the sandbox environment:  

[Quotes API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/quotes-api/index.md)   

[Quote Confirmation APIs](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/quote-confirmation-apis/index.md)   

[Payment API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/payment-api/index.md)   

[Retrieve Payment API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/retrieve-payment-api/index.md)   

[Carded Rate Pull API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/carded-rate-api/index.md)   

[Cancel Payment API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/cancel-payment-api/index.md)   

[Balance API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/balance-api/index.md)   

[Update Request API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/update-request-api/index.md)   

[Upload Document API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/upload-document-api/index.md)   

[Download Document API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/download-document-api/index.md)   

[Retrieve Request API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/retrieve-request-api/index.md)   
Note: The application is built for reference purposes only. Feel free to extend this for any other Cross-Border Services APIs as well. Your production application does not need to function the same way.

During this tutorial, you will:

1. Setup the Reference application, you can download repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Mastercard/crossborder-services-reference-application)
2. Set required keys for authentication
3. Execute use cases

## Step 1: Setting Up {#step-1-setting-up}

### a) Pre-requisites {#a-pre-requisites}

To complete this tutorial, you need:  

* Maven 3.5 or later
* JDK 1.8.0
* IntelliJ IDEA (or any other IDE of your choice)
* [Spring Framework](https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) 5.1.x is used to build this application.
* [Mastercard Developers Account](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) with access to Mastercard Cross-Border Services API and the signing keys generated. You would require the .p12 file, consumer key, keyalias and password from this step to proceed with the below steps. (Click [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/guide-create-project/index.md) for a step by step guide on account setup.)  

### b) Create a Maven Project {#b-create-a-maven-project}

In IntelliJ IDEA, create a new Maven project from Version control.   

* This will clone repository from GitHub and set up your directory structure automatically.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_1.png)

* Test connection before going ahead
  ![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_2.png)

* Clicking on clone will start cloning the repository
  ![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_3.png)

* At the lower right corner in your IDE, you will be prompted to add this project as a maven Project. **Please add as a Maven project.**
  ![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_mvn_4.png)
  You can also view this setting in the event log window, it can be opened from Tool windows in the View menu.  

### c) Add resources {#c-add-resources}

* As part of the [Mastercard Developers Account](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) setup (as described in pre-requisites section above), Sandbox Signing Key will be generated within your project. Add the generated .p12 file to the resources folder.

### d) Update properties file {#d-update-properties-file}

* You can view directory structure of reference application in Project view.
  ![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_config_1.png)  

* Open mastercard-api.properties in resources folder. This properties file defines default endpoint URL and partner for API calls. It also has some other fields which are required for authentication.

* As part of the [Mastercard Developers Account](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) setup (as described in pre-requisites section above), you will also get the consumer key, keyalias and password. Set these values in mastercard-api.properties.   

* Example

```Example
mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.keyFile=classpath:key.p12

mastercard.api.authentication.consumerKey=YourConsumerKey

mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.keyalias=YourKeyAlias

mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.password=YourKeystorePassword
```

### e) Add dependencies {#e-add-dependencies}

* Open maven view in IDE and run maven clean and install. This will add dependencies to your project.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_prj_maven_upd.png)  

## Step 2: Executing the use cases {#step-2-executing-the-use-cases}

* Open the README.md in the reference application and read through the use cases to understand Cross-Border Service API functionality.   
* To test Quotes API, open QuotesAPITest.java, right click on any of the use case and click on run. It will execute that use case.   
  Please note, input for every use case is setup in CrossBorderAPITestHelper.java. Cross-Border Service APIs supports both XML and Json.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_use_case.png)
You may similarly test all the APIs by executing the usecases listed in the respective xxxxTest.java file.  

### ++Encryption:++ {#uencryptionu}

* Cross-Border Services application requires payload encryption. To know details about encryption, go through [Enabling encryption](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md). **You may contact [support](mailto:APISupport@mastercard.com) to get required keys and files for the same**   

To encrypt / decrypt request and response payloads, you must set the additional properties in mastercard-api.properties.   
* Example

```Example
mastercard.api.environment.runWithEncryptedPayload=true

mastercard.api.encryption.certificateFile=classpath:YourCertFile.crt 

mastercard.api.encryption.fingerPrint=YourFingerPrint 

mastercard.api.decryption.keyFile=classpath:YourKeyFile.key 

```

Note:   

**.crt file** must be extracted using the .pem file that can be downloaded from your [Project page](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) by clicking on the project and using the **Actions \> Download Encryption Key** under the Client Encryption Keys section.   

**.key file** is the .p12 file downloaded at time of encryption key creation.

#### Some recommendations: {#some-recommendations}

These are just recommendations. You are not required to use open ssl but may use any favorable tool.

* ++Creating **.cert file** from **.pem file**++:

  * Encryption_cert_generation

  ```Encryption_cert_generation
  openssl x509 -outform der -in ./MastercardSendCrossBorderClientEncxxxxxxxxxx.pem -out ./MastercardSendCrossBorderClientEncxxxxxxxxx.crt

  ```

  <br />

* ++Decrypting response payload using private key++:

* Decryption_key_generation

```Decryption_key_generation
openssl pkcs12 -in keyalias-encryption-mc.p12 -nocerts -out <filename1>.key.pem --nodes
openssl rsa -in <filename1>.key.pem -out <filename2>.text.pem --text
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -in <filename2>.text.pem -out <filename3>.key --nocrypt

```

source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/carded-rate-api/index.md

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information. Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, please proceed to [Carded Rate API Specifications for EU](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-carded-rate-api/index.md) and [Carded Rate API Specification for UK](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-carded-rate-api/index.md) respectively to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

Carded Rate is offered, **for configured service corridors** , as an opt-in functionality to obtain the FX rates for the currency pairs that you, as the Customer support, for a valid period of time.
Please see [Payment with Carded Rate](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/payment-with-carded-rate/index.md) for more information on usage of the carded rates.
The two options available to obtain the carded rates are as follows:  

1. FX Rate Pull API: This is a Pull API that you may send a request to obtain Carded Rate, and  
2. FX Rate Push Notification: This is a push notifictaion where Mastercard would send the notifications as and when the rates are available.  

This page describes the details on both the options available for obtaining the carded rates.
Note: Prior to using these API/ Notification, you must opt-in for this service by contacting your Mastercard representative.

## Environment Domains {#environment-domains}

### ++FX Rate Pull++ {#ufx-rate-pullu}

* Sandbox
* MTF
* Production

```Sandbox
Sandbox testing is unavailable for Carded Rate APIs.
```

```MTF
https://sandbox.api.mastercard.com/send/v1/partners/{partner-id}/crossborder/rates
```

```Production
https://api.mastercard.com/send/v1/partners/{partner-id}/crossborder/rates
```

### ++FX Rate Push++ {#ufx-rate-pushu}

* This is a push Notification and webhook endpoint will need to be provided by you for Mastercard to send the FX Rates.

Note:
* Contact your mastercard representative for mTLS push notification mastercard public certificate. This certificate needs to be trusted by the receiving application. Also, please share the server certificate chain for validation (via KMP portal), if those are accepted on mastercard infrastructure.
* Once done, FX rates can be sent by Mastercard to the other party.
* During the onboarding process, Mastercard will assign a registered partner ID to test in the higher environments (MTF Test and Production).

### FX Rate Pull {#fx-rate-pull}

[**Open Specification**](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/cross-border-swagger.yaml)

The FX Rate Pull API will require you to create a scheduler, **for configured service corridors**, that will call this API based on the refresh times per currency pair provided by Cross-Border Services.

API Reference: `GET /send/v1/partners/{partner-id}/crossborder/rates`

* **Formats supported** : XML/ JSON  
* **HTTP Version**: 1.0/ 1.1
* **Required HTTP header parameters** :   
  content-type : Format of the inbound content being submitted. example: application/json   
  content-length: Length of the inbound content body in octets.   
  Accept: Format of the expected response must be provided in this header field. Example - application/json

### FX Rate Push {#fx-rate-push}

[**Open Specification**](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/cross-border-webhook-swagger.yaml)

The FX Rate Push, once coded to, will provide the ability for Cross-Border Services to push all FX rates, **for configured service corridors**, to the Customer that are refreshing at the time of the push without any requests by the Customer. Depending on the number and FX refresh schedules of the rates, the Customer should expect to receive multiple pushes a day.

API Reference: `POST /callbackpath`

Tip: It is a Cross-Border Services best practice for any customer who codes to the Push API to also code to the Pull API so that the pull API can be used as a backup in case FX rates are not received for any reason.

* **Formats supported** : JSON  
* **HTTP Version**: 1.0/ 1.1
* **Required HTTP header parameters** :   
  content-type : Format of the inbound content being submitted. example: application/json   
  content-length: Length of the inbound content body in octets.

# Balance API
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/balance-api/index.md

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information. Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, please proceed to [Balance API Specifications for EU](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-balance-api/index.md) and [Balance API Specification for UK](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-balance-api/index.md) respectively to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

You can use this API to obtain account details including balances if you are contracted with a MTS legal entity and enabled for [prefunding settlement or collateral settlement](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/settlement-model/index.md).

## Environment Domains {#environment-domains}

Note: **Sandbox** and **MTF** environments share the same url but are differentiated by partner id.

## API {#api}

[**Open Specification**](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/cross-border-swagger.yaml)

### Retrieve All Accounts and Balances {#retrieve-all-accounts-and-balances}


API Reference: `GET /send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/accounts`

### Retrieve Account Balances by Account ID {#retrieve-account-balances-by-account-id}


API Reference: `GET /send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/accounts/{account_id}`

* **Formats supported** : JSON   
* **HTTP Version**: 1.0/ 1.1
* **Required HTTP header parameters** :   
  content-type : Format of the inbound content being submitted. example: application/ json   
  content-length: Length of the inbound content body in octets.

## API Convention {#api-convention}

Take a look at the [API Conventions](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-conventions/index.md) for general guidelines.

## Payload Encryption {#payload-encryption}

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the payload sent by Mastercard.   

For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)

## Sandbox Testing {#sandbox-testing}

You can make API calls to the Sandbox server from your application code using the [tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md), which involves creating a Mastercard Developers project and using the Sandbox keys to generate the required OAuth 1.0a Authorization Header.
Tip: During the onboarding process, Mastercard will assign a registered partner ID to test in the higher environments (MTF Test and Production). This partner ID will not be able to access the sandbox environment, but the customer can still access sandbox by using the non-registered partner ID.   
Any correctly formatted partner ID can be used in the sandbox. As a best practice, use the first 15 digits of your institution's name (alphanumeric and/or special characters, no spaces) as the Partner_ID.   
For testing in sandbox, please use unique transaction_reference on each run. Note: The sandbox does not return parameters unique to a specific Customer; such as pricing, limits, and corridor-specific data requirements, but allows you to test general call structure and responses outside of the production environment. After sandbox testing is completed, Customers meeting the eligibility requirements will be assigned a project manager to do integrated testing in the test environment that has been configured to include requested receiving corridors, current foreign exchange rates, and fixed and variable fees specific to the Customer.

### Test cases {#test-cases}

# Getting Started with the APIs using OAuth1.0A
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/getting-started-oauth1a/index.md

Follow the below listed step by step instructions to connect to the Cross-Border Services APIs using [OAuth1.0A](https://developer.mastercard.com/platform/documentation/security-and-authentication/using-oauth-1a-to-access-mastercard-apis/) as an authentication mechanism.
Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, you must use [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for Balance APIs and [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for all APIs (except Balance API) as the authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). Please proceed to [Getting Started with APIs using OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/getting-started-oauth2/index.md) for step by step instructions on how to setup.

## Step 1: Create Project and Project Keys {#step-1-create-project-and-project-keys}

To start using the Cross-Border Service APIs, you must create a [Mastercard Developers account](https://developer.mastercard.com/account/sign-up) and then create a project choosing the **Mastercard Cross-Border Services** API service. The project will generate the project keys required to use the APIs in each of the environments.
The [Quick Start Guide](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/guide-create-project/index.md) provides detailed information about creating a project and downloading the project keys.
In case, if you have an existing project, refer [Adding a new service to an existing project](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/guide-create-project/#adding-a-new-service-to-an-existing-project).
Note: Project keys are subject to annual renewal. Mastercard recommends that you use a group email address when creating your project to ensure that team members can access the Mastercard Developers account used for testing and production. For more details, see [Project Keys](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-security/index.md#project-keys)

## Step 2: Connect to the API {#step-2-connect-to-the-api}

You start connecting to the API in the **sandbox** environment, where you access API stubs that return simulated, static responses. See [Mastercard Environments](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/environments/index.md) for details.

The Cross-Border Service APIs are RESTful APIs with OAuth security. So for all environments, your API requests must have an OAuth 1.0a Authorization Header for authentication and your request payload must be encrypted.  

### ++a) Authentication:++ {#ua-authenticationu}

Generate the OAuth 1.0a Authorization Header using the appropriate Signing Key and Consumer Key. You can implement your own OAuth 1.0a header or use the relevant Mastercard OAuth libraries (available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mastercard?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=oauth)). For guidance, refer to the README.md file with the libraries.
For detailed information on using OAuth 1.0a with the Cross-Border Service APIs and generating Authorization Headers, see [Using OAuth 1.0a to Access Mastercard APIs](https://developer.mastercard.com/platform/documentation/using-oauth-1a-to-access-mastercard-apis)

### ++b) Encryption:++ {#ub-encryptionu}

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the response payload sent by Mastercard. For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)   

**Note**: API error responses are not encrypted.

### ++c) Connection:++ {#uc-connection-u}

Connect to Cross-Border Service API, using any of the below two options:

#### ++Option 1: Direct Integration with APIs (using any REST client)++ {#uoption-1-direct-integration-with-apis-using-any-rest-client-u}

For your convenience, we have created a Reference application that demonstrates how to connect to the various Cross-Border Service APIs using a REST client. You may download the sample reference application [here](https://github.com/Mastercard/crossborder-services-reference-application).   

**Note**: The application built is for reference purposes only. Your production application does not need to function the same way.

Look at the [Reference App Tutorial](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/ref-app/reference-app-tutorial/index.md) if you need further help.

#### ++Option 2: Generate SDK to integrate with APIs++ {#uoption-2-generate-sdk-to-integrate-with-apisu}

Another way is to generate a simple client using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/integrations/) along with the [Mastercard libraries for authentication](https://github.com/Mastercard?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=oauth) and use the client to connect to the Mastercard Cross-Border Services APIs.  

Take a look at the [API Tutorial](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/api-sdk-tutorial/index.md) that shows a simple example on how to make an API call by generating client SDK to connect to the Cross-Border Service API.

## Next Steps {#next-steps}

1. Once you have successfully connected to the Cross-Border Service APIs, you will be able to test the APIs in the sandbox environment. Please refer to the respective APIs under [API Reference](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/index.md) for the sandbox test cases and sample request/ response.

2. Prior to the next phase of testing, a project should be opened to properly assign resources. Mastercard will ensure eligibility requirements are met.

<!-- -->

3. When you are ready to test with the full APIs and have met the eligibility requirements, you can ask your Mastercard representative for access to the MTF environment as shown [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/guide-mtf-access/index.md)

4. For MTF testing, your assigned Mastercard implementation manager will provide you a **Partner ID** assigned to your organization, a detailed test plan and test cases specific to your program requirements and the destination endpoints you have selected.

5. Once you have successfully made test requests and your application has appropriately handled the responses, you will be provided a detailed **Technical Endpoint Guide** unique to your program requirements that will include specific information about the fields required vs. optional based on the destination endpoints you have selected. It is required that you perform development against these specifications prior to the next phase of testing.

6. Once MTF testing is complete, you can request Production access for your project (refer [step-by-step guide](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/guide-move-to-production/index.md) ), which requires approval from Mastercard and assistance from the Mastercard's Customer Implementation Services (CIS) Team.

source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/ref-app/oauth2-reference-app-tutorial-access-token/index.md

###### Time to complete: *20 minutes*

## Introduction {#introduction}

If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, you must connect using [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for Balance APIs as the authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).  

This tutorial demonstrates how a simple web application can connect to the Cross-Border Service APIs using Request Token based OAuth2.0 authentication mechanism and execute/ manage the payment transactions. This includes making API calls with the use of Rest client to the following Cross-Border Service APIs in the sandbox environment:  

**Quotes API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-quotes-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-quotes-api/index.md))   

**Payment API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-payment-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-payment-api/index.md))   

**Retrieve Payment API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-retrieve-payment-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-retrieve-payment-api/index.md))   

**Carded Rate Pull API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-carded-rate-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-carded-rate-api/index.md))   

**Cancel Payment API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-cancel-payment-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-cancel-payment-api/index.md))   

**Balance API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-balance-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-balance-api/index.md))   

**Download Document API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-eu-download-document-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-uk-download-document-api/index.md))   

**Upload Document API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-eu-upload-document-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-uk-upload-document-api/index.md))   

**Upload Request API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-eu-update-request-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-uk-update-request-api/index.md))   

**Retrieve Request API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-eu-retrieve-request-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-uk-retrieve-request-api/index.md))   
Note: The application is built for reference purposes only. Feel free to extend this for any other Cross-Border Services APIs as well. Your production application does not need to function the same way.   

During this tutorial, you will:

1. Setup the Reference application, you can download repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Mastercard/crossborder-services-reference-app-oauth2)
2. Set required keys for authentication
3. Execute use cases

## Step 1: Setting Up {#step-1-setting-up}

### a) Pre-requisites {#a-pre-requisites}

To complete this tutorial, you need:  

* Maven 3.5 or later
* JDK 1.8.0
* IntelliJ IDEA (or any other IDE of your choice)
* [Spring Framework](https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) 5.1.x is used to build this application.
* [Mastercard Developers Account](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) with access to Mastercard Cross-Border Services API and the signing keys generated. You would require the .p12 file, consumer key, keyalias and password from this step to proceed with the below steps. (Click [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/guide-create-project/index.md) for a step by step guide on account setup.)  
* For Sandbox EU/UK domain testing, mTLS client certificate(.PKCS12 or .PFX file) is not needed. For MTF and PROD, connect with your local representative to get the mTLS certificates, to consume APIs.

### b) Create a Maven Project for Reference Application {#b-create-a-maven-project-for-reference-application}

In IntelliJ IDEA, create a new Maven project from Version control.   

* This will clone repository from GitHub and set up your directory structure automatically.

* Test connection before going ahead
  ![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_psd2_2.png)

* Clicking on clone will start cloning the repository
  ![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_psd2_3.png)

* At the lower right corner in your IDE, you will be prompted to add this project as a maven Project. **Please add as a Maven project.**
  ![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_mvn_psd2_4.png)
  You can also view this setting in the event log window, it can be opened from Tool windows in the View menu.  

### c) Add resources {#c-add-resources}

* As part of the [Mastercard Developers Account](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) setup (as described in pre-requisites section above), Sandbox Signing Key will be generated within your project. Add the generated .p12 file to the resources folder.

* For MTF and PROD, please make sure .PKCS12 or .PFX file(obtained from local representative) is also present in resources folder. For Sandbox EU/UK testing, mTLS client certificate is not needed.

### d) Update properties file {#d-update-properties-file}

* You can view directory structure of reference application in Project view.

* Open mastercard-api.properties in resources folder. This properties file defines default endpoint URL and partner for API calls. It also has some other fields which are required for authentication.  

As part of the [Mastercard Developers Account](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) setup (as described in pre-requisites section above), you will also get the consumer key, keyalias and password. Set these values in mastercard-api.properties.   
* Example

```Example
mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.keyFile=classpath:key.p12

mastercard.api.authentication.consumerKey=YourConsumerKey

mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.keyalias=YourKeyAlias

mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.password=YourKeystorePassword
```

Set the following properties in the mastercard-api.properties file for MTLS (For Sandbox EU/UK Testing, keep mTLS properties empty):
* Example

```Example
    
  mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.mtlsFile=yourPFXFile
  mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.mtlsPassword=yourPFXPassword

```

Note:   

For Access Token based authorisation flow, below properties are required.

To get the access token, please refer [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md).
Set the generated accessToken and runAllAPIsWithAccessToken flag to true, to enable access token in mastercard-api.properties.
* Oauth

```Oauth
    
  mastercard.api.environment.runAllAPIsWithAccessToken=true
  mastercard.api.environment.oauth2.accessToken=yourAccessToken

```

Please ensure you use the correct EU/UK endpoints by looking at respective API specifications. For your convenience, the below screenshots shows EU and UK examples respectively.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_config_2.png)  

### e) Add resources {#e-add-resources}

* Open maven view in IDE and run maven clean and install. This will add dependencies to your project.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_prj_maven_upd.png)  

## Step 2: Executing the use cases {#step-2-executing-the-use-cases}

* Open the README.md in the reference application and read through the use cases to understand Cross-Border Service API functionality.   
* To test Quotes API, open QuotesAPITest.java, right click on any of the use case and click on run. It will execute that use case.   
  Please note, input for every use case is setup in CrossBorderAPITestHelper.java. Cross-Border Service APIs supports both XML and Json.

Note: Request Token generation is implicitly handled in the code base using Consumer Key, P12 File, Signing Key Alias \& Signing Key Password.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_use_case.png)
You may similarly test all the APIs by executing the usecases listed in the respective xxxxTest.java file.  

### ++Encryption:++ {#uencryptionu}

* Cross-Border Services application requires payload encryption. To know details about encryption, go through [Enabling encryption](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md).   
  **You may contact [support](mailto:APISupport@mastercard.com) to get required keys and files for the same**   

To encrypt / decrypt request and response payloads, set properties in mastercard-api.properties.
* Example

```Example
mastercard.api.environment.runWithEncryptedPayload=true

mastercard.api.encryption.certificateFile=classpath:YourCertFile.crt 

mastercard.api.encryption.fingerPrint=YourFingerPrint 

mastercard.api.decryption.keyFile=classpath:YourKeyFile.key 

```

Note:   

**.crt file** must be extracted using the .pem file that can be downloaded from your [Project page](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) by clicking on the project and using the **Actions \> Download Encryption Key** under the Client Encryption Keys section.   

**.key file** is the .p12 file downloaded at time of encryption key creation.

#### Some recommendations: {#some-recommendations}

These are just recommendations. You are not required to use open ssl but may use any favorable tool.

* ++Creating **.cert file** from **.pem file**++:

# Getting Started with the APIs using OAuth2.0
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/getting-started-oauth2/index.md

If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, you must connect using [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for Balance APIs and [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for all other APIs as the authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).   

Please follow the below step by step instructions to connect to the Mastercard Cross-Border Services APIs.

## Step 1: Create Project and Project Keys {#step-1-create-project-and-project-keys}

To start using the Cross-Border Service APIs, you must create a [Mastercard Developers account](https://developer.mastercard.com/account/sign-up) and then create a project choosing the **Mastercard Cross-Border Services** API service. The project will generate the project keys required to use the APIs in each of the environments.
The [Quick Start Guide](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/guide-create-project/index.md) provides detailed information about creating a project and downloading the project keys.
In case, if you have an existing project, refer [Adding a new service to an existing project](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/guide-create-project/#adding-a-new-service-to-an-existing-project).
Note:   

* The Quick Start Guide referred above steps through the OAuth1.0A key creation. Please follow the same steps since we will be using the same keys for this flow as well.

* Project keys are subject to **annual** renewal. Mastercard recommends that you use a group email address when creating your project to ensure that team members can access the Mastercard Developers account used for testing and production.
  For more details, see [Project Keys](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-security/index.md#project-keys)

## Step 2: Exchange Certificates to enable mTLS {#step-2-exchange-certificates-to-enable-mtls}

To be able to make a successful Cross-Border Services API call, you will first require to establish MTLS connectivity between your application and Mastercard's Cross-Border Services APIs.
Please follow the instructions [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-mtls-setup/index.md) to setup MTLS.

If you have already setup the MTLS certificate via Mastercard's Key Management Portal (KMP) tool and need to renew your certificates, please click [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-mtls-cert-renewal/index.md) for instructions.
Note:
* For Sandbox EU/UK domain testing, mTLS certificate is not needed. APIs can be directly accessed using REQUEST and ACCESS Token.

## Step 3: Connect to the Mastercard Cross-Border Services APIs {#step-3-connect-to-the-mastercard-cross-border-services-apis}

You start connecting to the API in the **sandbox** environment, where you access API stubs that return simulated, static responses. See [Mastercard Environments](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/environments/index.md) for details.

The Cross-Border Service APIs are RESTful APIs with OAuth security in conformity with Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

### ++a) Authentication:++ {#ua-authenticationu}

Generate the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Header using the appropriate token flows as follows:

|                             |                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All APIs except Balance API | [Use OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) |
| Balance API                 | [Use OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md)   |

Note: Host header must be passed with every API request. It should refer to the mtf.api.xbs.mastercard.eu/uk in case of MTF and sandbox.api.xbs.mastercard.eu/uk in case of sandbox.

### ++b) Encryption:++ {#ub-encryptionu}

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the response payload sent by Mastercard. For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md).   

**NOTE**: API error responses are not encrypted.

### ++c) Connection:++ {#uc-connection-u}

Connect to Cross-Border Service API using any of the below two options:

#### ++Option 1: Direct Integration with APIs (using any REST client)++ {#uoption-1-direct-integration-with-apis-using-any-rest-clientu}

For your convenience, we have created a Reference application that demonstrates how to connect to the various Cross-Border Service APIs using a REST client. You may download the [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow sample reference](https://github.com/Mastercard/crossborder-services-reference-app-oauth2) and [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow sample reference](https://github.com/Mastercard/crossborder-services-reference-app-oauth2).   

**Note** : The application built is for reference purposes only. Your production application does not need to function the same way.

Look at the [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow Reference Tutorial](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/ref-app/oauth2-reference-app-tutorial-access-token/index.md) and [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow Reference Tutorial](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/ref-app/oauth2-reference-app-tutorial-request-token/index.md) for step by step instructions.

#### ++Option 2: Generate SDK to integrate with APIs++ {#uoption-2-generate-sdk-to-integrate-with-apisu}

Another way is to generate a simple client using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/integrations/) along with the [Mastercard libraries for authentication](https://github.com/Mastercard?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=oauth)) and use the client to connect to the Mastercard Cross-Border Services APIs.  

Take a look at the API Tutorial for [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/oauth2-api-sdk-tutorial-request-token/index.md) that shows a simple example on how to make an API call by generating client SDK to connect to the Cross-Border Service API.

## Next Steps {#next-steps}

1. Once you have successfully connected to the Cross-Border Service APIs, you will be able to test the APIs in the sandbox environment. Please refer to the respective APIs under [API Reference](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/index.md) for the sandbox test cases and sample request/ response.

2. Prior to the next phase of testing, a project should be opened to properly assign resources. Mastercard will ensure eligibility requirements are met.

<!-- -->

3. When you are ready to test with the full APIs and have met the eligibility requirements, you can ask your Mastercard representative for access to the MTF environment as shown [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/guide-mtf-access/index.md)

4. For MTF testing, your assigned Mastercard implementation manager will provide you a **Partner ID** assigned to your organization, a detailed test plan and test cases specific to your program requirements and the destination endpoints you have selected.

5. Once you have successfully made test requests and your application has appropriately handled the responses, you will be provided a detailed **Technical Endpoint Guide** unique to your program requirements that will include specific information about the fields required vs. optional based on the destination endpoints you have selected. It is required that you perform development against these specifications prior to the next phase of testing.

6. Once MTF testing is complete, you can request Production access for your project (refer [step-by-step guide](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/guide-move-to-production/index.md) ), which requires approval from Mastercard and assistance from the Mastercard's Customer Implementation Services (CIS) Team.

# Payload Encryption
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md

## Introduction {#introduction}

Mastercard APIs are secured through an authentication process where only authorized clients, with a valid digital signature are granted access.
Payload encryption provides an additional layer of security.

The encrypted payload is structured in JSON Web Encryption (JWE) format, the plain text JSON body is encrypted to form a JWE encrypted payload that is inserted into the request body(replacing the plain text data). The encryption process uses the appropriate public encryption key for the environment.

For further details, refer to the [JWE IETF standard - (RFC 7516)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516#section-3.1)

## How to Enable Encryption {#how-to-enable-encryption}

Customers may set up payload encryption for partner-initiated transactions (such as for Quotes, Payment and Retrieve Payment APIs) on their own by following these steps:

**Step 1:** Create Encryption keys. See [How to Create Encryption Keys](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md#how-to-create-encryption-keys) section below.   

**Step 2:** Provide encrypted payload. See [How to Encrypt Payload](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md#how-to-encrypt-payload) section below.  

**Step 3:** Include the **x-encrypted: true** HTTP Header. Please refer the [HTTP header](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md#http-header-parameters) section below.

## How to Create Encryption Keys {#how-to-create-encryption-keys}

Once you log into your Mastercard Developers account on [Mastercard Developer site](https://developer.mastercard.com/account/log-in), there are two ways to create encryption keys.

**Option 1:** Create keys with new project creation:  
The [Quick Start Guide](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/guide-create-project/index.md) provides detailed information about creating a project and the project keys in Sandbox/MTF environment.
For creating encryption keys in production, you can request Production access for your project (refer [step-by-step guide](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/guide-move-to-production/index.md) )

**Option 2:** Add Keys to existing project:  
To add keys to an existing project, simply click "Add Key" (next to the Client Encryption Keys)

## How to Encrypt Payload {#how-to-encrypt-payload}

Please follow the below steps to encrypt the payload as per above format:

**Step 1:** Construct the original JSON or XML Request per the API specification.   

**Step 2:** Use JWE to encrypt the original request in compact serialized form using the below JOSE headers:

|    JOSE Header     |                Value                |                                                   Description                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Testing Encrypted Payload {#testing-encrypted-payload}

**Live customers** wanting to test API payload encryption for partner-initiated transactions (such as Quotes, Payment and Retrieve payment APIs) can self-validate in the MTF and production environments by following the above steps then confirming:  

1. Successful Response  
2. X-encrypted field set to True in HTTP header.

If support is needed, live customers should reach out to their Mastercard Customer Support team.

**New customers** will test basic API payload encryption in Sandbox environment.
Specialized testing scenarios will be performed with the Customer Implementation Services (CIS) team during onboarding.

## Encrypted Push Notifications {#encrypted-push-notifications}

**Live** and **New customers** wanting to set up encryption for push notifications (such as Status change and Carded rates) will need to coordinate MTF/Production testing with the Customer Implementation Services team by opening a project.

The CIS Team will ask for the Open API Client ID for both MTF and Production when setting up the encrypted push notifications.  

Test accounts to initiate push transactions will be provided if necessary.

# Research summary
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/experience-design-guide/research-summary/index.md

### What we learned was invaluable {#what-we-learned-was-invaluable}

We asked hundreds of consumers to test Cross Border Services and provide feedback over several rounds of testing. Below are the summarized research criteria and results, which we used to update and improve our XBS experience.

### Design Quality Score results {#design-quality-score-results}

The Design Quality Score is one of the several CX metrics leveraged by Mastercard to quantifiably measure the quality of the design, experience, and content. In a Design Quality Score study, consumers are asked to interact with the design of a concept and gauge how well that design meets their needs. Each study is graded on three overarching Themes - Emotion, Ease, and Effectiveness.

<br />


We tested with 263 participants across two markets - EU and AP. We specifically recruited people who regularly use digital apps and mobile wallets to send and receive money internationally. **The experience scored a 90 out of 100 in the EU and 84 out of 100 in the AP.**
![Overview](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/research-summary-1.png)

### What we tested {#what-we-tested}

* Cross border payment to a new recipient
* Cross border payment to a saved recipient
* Payment tracking

![Overview](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/research-summary-2.png)

### What we learned {#what-we-learned}

* Most end users found the fees, exchange rate and total to be clear and affordable across the payment flows. Providing details such as fees and transfer time made it easier for the end users to choose a suitable payment option.
* Ability to control who should cover the fee was noted as an innovative feature.
* The transparency provided by the experience mitigated end-user concerns around security and created a sense of trustworthiness. Consumers felt that the ability to track payments made the money transfer app more reliable.
* Almost half of users said they would cover transaction fees when sending money, but the other half said that their decision depends on the payment's purpose and their relationship with the receiver. They expected business recipients to pay the fees, but not family.
* 59% of end users said they would prefer to delay delivery by a day to lower the overall cost of the transaction. However, their choice could change depending on the urgency of the situation.
* 12% of the users expressed confusion around the meaning of '15 min' and how it is related to the FX rate.
* Around 14 end users in AP were curious about the feasibility of the cash pickup option shown. \* In terms of endpoint preference, 62% of users across EU and AP say they prefer to send international payments to a bank account as it feels the safest. 31% of users across EU and AP selected digital wallets since it feels easier, faster and more affordable. No user-selected cash-pickups in the EU region. But 16% of users preferred cash pickups in AP, especially to send money to recipients without a bank account.

### Outcomes from research {#outcomes-from-research}

As a result of our research, we updated the flows with more information around the 15 minute guaranteed exchange rate, the source of the FX rate and details on how cash pick-up will work.

# Payment (without Quote or Carded Rate)
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/payment/index.md

This type of payment applies the FX rate conversion available at the time of the transaction processing for the sender.   
For the complete list of supported transaction types, see [Use Cases.](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/index.md)

The pricing model that you follow will help determine the type of the API call that you will use, the content you will send inside the API call, and the timing of when FX rates are retrieved. Learn more about the [Pricing Model](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/pricing-model/index.md).

Payment without quote can be achieved in three different ways:

## 1. Forward Payment (fees included) {#1-forward-payment-fees-included}

This is a forward Payment in which the sender specifies the Sending amount and currency for a payment including any applicable service fees and the amount received by recipient in the receiver currency is calculated.

##### ++Customer Managed Sender Pricing (CMSP) for an Originating Institution flow++: {#ucustomer-managed-sender-pricing-cmsp-for-an-originating-institution-flowu}

As an example, below sequence shows a payment transaction of 100 USD to Phillippines as a forward payment including the service fees, in [CMSP](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/pricing-model/index.md) model.   

**Note**: The Originating Institution (OI) gets the rates from Cross-Border Services ahead of time and feeds into their system either using carded rates mechanism or Quotes API. This flow is not shown in the below diagram. For this example, let's assume the FX rate for USD to PHP conversion provided by Mastercard is 50 and service fees is 2 USD.
Diagram send-fwd-wo-quote-fees-cmsp-sequence

##### ++Mastercard Managed Sender Pricing (MMSP) for an Originating Institution flow++: {#umastercard-managed-sender-pricing-mmsp-for-an-originating-institution-flowu}

As an example, below sequence shows a payment transaction of 100 USD to Phillippines as a forward payment including the service fees, in [MMSP](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/pricing-model/index.md) model.
Diagram send-fwd-wo-quote-fees-mmsp-sequence

## 2. Forward Payment (fees Not included) {#2-forward-payment-fees-not-included}

This is a forward Payment in which the sender specifies the Sending amount and currency for a payment and Mastercard calculates the the amount received by the end recipient and also the amount charged to the sender with the service fees applied on top of the request send amount.

##### ++Customer Managed Sender Pricing (CMSP) for an Originating Institution flow++: {#ucustomer-managed-sender-pricing-cmsp-for-an-originating-institution-flowu-1}

As an example, below sequence shows a payment transaction of 100 USD to Phillippines as a forward payment and apply the service fees on top of the sending amount, in [CMSP](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/pricing-model/index.md) model

Diagram send-fwd-wo-quote-wo-fees-mmsp-sequence

## 3. Reverse Payment {#3-reverse-payment}

This is a reverse payment in which the receiving amount in receiver currency is specified by the sender and the total amount charged to the sender is calculated.

##### ++Customer Managed Sender Pricing (CMSP) for an Originating Institution flow++: {#ucustomer-managed-sender-pricing-cmsp-for-an-originating-institution-flowu-2}

As an example, below sequence shows a payment transaction of 5000 PHP as a reverse payment, in [CMSP](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/pricing-model/index.md) model.   

**Note**: The Originating Institution (OI) gets the rates from Cross-Border Services ahead of time and feeds into their system either using carded rates mechanism or Quotes API.

# Sender Account URI
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/additional-resources/common-sender-acct-uri/index.md

For all transactions, including nested payments, the Sender Account URI scheme is a mandatory field based on the account that is initiating the transaction and must contain the ultimate sender's unique account details for the actual mobile wallet, ewallet, account identifier, bank account or card that is initiating the transaction. Accordingly, this field should not include a blanket or general account managed by the Debtor Agent.

Where a bank account is the account type initiating the transaction, the international bank account number (iban) or bank account number (ban) scheme must be provided. If the initiating account is not tel, iban, or ban, then the ewallet scheme may be used. In such cases, the URI should be an identifier of the person transacting, such as the unique ID of the sender in the OI's system.

| Scheme  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Scheme Specific Data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tel     | E.164 number identifying a Telephony Subscriber. The number (usually a MSISDN) must be expressed as an E164 number containing: \[+\]\[country code\]\[area code\]\[local phone number\] + - plus sign country code - international country code area code/national destination code - code without leading 0 phone number - local phone number The '+' sign is mandatory (it is compliant with RFC3966 format / international number only). Example: | Country | Local Phone Number | E.164 Formatted Number | |---------|--------------------|------------------------| | USA     | 415 123 1234       | +14151231234           | | UK      | 020 1234 1234      | +442012341234          | |
| iban    | International Bank Account Number as an ISO 13616:2007 identifier, case sensitive. This scheme is provided for convenience. You may prefer use the BAN scheme instead. A receiver system that supports IBAN-based identification of its managed accounts should also support BAN-based identification for those same accounts. Data format: alpha-numeric, max length: 34 Example: iban:CH5108686001256515001                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| pan     | Specifies a card account number with a maximum length of 35 and a minimum length of 12. Data format: NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN\[NNN\]\[;exp=YYYY-MM\]. Examples: pan:5432123456789012;exp=2017-02 pan:5432123456789012333;exp=2017-02                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ban     | Bank Account Number A bank account number (BAN) identifier, formed by the account number (its format depends on the bank involved) and the bank identifier code (BIC). This scheme is suitable to identify most bank accounts worldwide, contrary to the IBAN scheme, which is mostly limited to European bank accounts. The BIC is formed by 8 uppercase alpha numeric characters, optionally followed by a 3 alpha numeric character branch code. Data format: alpha-numeric;bic=\<\<bic\>bic\> With \<\<bic\>bic\> matching the ISO 9362 standard, in uppercase. Example: ban:30056001140114000251817;bic=CCFRFRPP                                                                        |
| ewallet | E-Wallet account identifier. As there is no standard to identify an e-wallet account globally, the payment provider must decide with its SP what the exact format of such an ID will be. To help keep the format simple and avoid collisions between SP's local identification convention, an additional URI parameter named 'sp' may be used, identifying the e-wallet account provider. With such a model, each SP can keep its local e-wallet identification scheme and transpose it transparently. Data format: alpha-numeric Examples: Using the sp URI parameter: ewallet:user011;sp=paypal Using a naming convention (not transparent for the SP): ewallet:paypal_user011 ewallet:    |

The platform will add the following VSF fields along with mentioned validator, and the Mexico service provider will be set up for them in accordance with the specifications below.

## Adding a new service to an existing project {#adding-a-new-service-to-an-existing-project}

If you intend to use multiple Mastercard API services, such as Mastercard Send and Mastercard Cross-Border Services, you can add them to the same Mastercard Developers project and use the same keys and credentials to access the APIs.

To add an API service to an existing project:

1. In Mastercard Developers, open your project.

2. In the Summary panel, click **Add a new API to this project.**

3. Select the API service you want to add to the project, such as **Mastercard Cross-Border Services.**

4. If the new API can use keys that are not currently set up for your project, such as additional payload encryption keys, you will see setup panels relating to those keys. Provide the required details to generate the keys, and store the downloaded key files and details securely. **Click Open project.**

Your project's Summary panel will now show the new API.

| iban    | International Bank Account Number as an ISO 13616:2007 identifier, case sensitive. This scheme is provided for convenience. You may prefer use the BAN scheme instead. A receiver system that supports IBAN-based identification of its managed accounts should also support BAN-based identification for those same accounts. Data format: alpha-numeric, max length: 34 Example: iban:CH5108686001256515001                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ban     | Bank Account Number A bank account number (BAN) identifier, formed by the account number (its format depends on the bank involved) and the bank identifier code (BIC). This scheme is suitable to identify most bank accounts worldwide, contrary to the IBAN scheme, which is mostly limited to European bank accounts. The BIC is formed by 8 uppercase alpha numeric characters, optionally followed by a 3 alpha numeric character branch code. Data format: alpha-numeric;bic=\<\<bic\>bic\> With \<\<bic\>bic\> matching the ISO 9362 standard, in uppercase Example: ban:30056001140114000251817;bic=CCFRFRPP                                                                         |
| ewallet | E-Wallet account identifier As there is no standard to identify an e-wallet account globally, the payment provider must decide with its SP what the exact format of such an ID will be. To help keep the format simple and avoid collisions between SP's local identification convention, an additional URI parameter named 'sp' may be used, identifying the e-wallet account provider. With such a model, each SP can keep its local e-wallet identification scheme and transpose it transparently. Data format: alpha-numeric Example: Using the sp URI parameter: ewallet:user011;sp=paypal Using a naming conventions (not transparent for the SP): ewallet:paypal_user011 ewallet:     |

# Reference Application Tutorial for Request Token based OAuth2.0
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/ref-app/oauth2-reference-app-tutorial-request-token/index.md

###### Time to complete: *20 minutes*

## Introduction {#introduction}

If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, you must connect using [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for all APIs (except Balance API), as the authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).  

This tutorial demonstrates how a simple web application can connect to the Cross-Border Service APIs using Request Token based OAuth2.0 authentication mechanism and execute/ manage the payment transactions. This includes making API calls with the use of Rest client to the following Cross-Border Service APIs in the sandbox environment:  

**Quotes API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-quotes-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-quotes-api/index.md))   

**Payment API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-payment-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-payment-api/index.md))   

**Retrieve Payment API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-retrieve-payment-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-retrieve-payment-api/index.md))   

**Carded Rate Pull API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-carded-rate-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-carded-rate-api/index.md))   

**Cancel Payment API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-cancel-payment-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-cancel-payment-api/index.md))   

**Balance API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-balance-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-balance-api/index.md))   

**Download Document API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-eu-download-document-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-uk-download-document-api/index.md))   

**Upload Document API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-eu-upload-document-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-uk-upload-document-api/index.md))   

**Upload Request API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-eu-update-request-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-uk-update-request-api/index.md))   

**Retrieve Request API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-eu-retrieve-request-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-uk-retrieve-request-api/index.md))   
Note: The application is built for reference purposes only. Feel free to extend this for any other Cross-Border Services APIs as well. Your production application does not need to function the same way.   

During this tutorial, you will:

1. Setup the Reference application, you can download repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Mastercard/crossborder-services-reference-app-oauth2)
2. Set required keys for authentication
3. Execute use cases

* For Sandbox EU/UK domain testing, mTLS client certificate(.PKCS12 or .PFX file) is not needed. For MTF and PROD, connect with your local representative to get the mTLS certificates, to consume APIs.

### b) Create a Maven Project for Reference Application {#b-create-a-maven-project-for-reference-application}

In IntelliJ IDEA, create a new Maven project from Version control.   

* This will clone repository from GitHub and set up your directory structure automatically.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_psd2_1.png)

* Test connection before going ahead
  ![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_psd2_2.png)

* Clicking on clone will start cloning the repository
  ![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_psd2_3.png)

* At the lower right corner in your IDE, you will be prompted to add this project as a maven Project. **Please add as a Maven project.**
  ![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_mvn_psd2_4.png)
  You can also view this setting in the event log window, it can be opened from Tool windows in the View menu.  

### c) Add resources {#c-add-resources}

* As part of the [Mastercard Developers Account](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) setup (as described in pre-requisites section above), Sandbox Signing Key will be generated within your project. Add the generated .p12 file to the resources folder.

* For MTF and PROD, please make sure .PKCS12 or .PFX file(obtained from local representative) is also present in resources folder. For Sandbox EU/UK domain testing, mTLS client certificate is not needed.

### d) Update properties file {#d-update-properties-file}

* You can view directory structure of reference application in Project view.

* Open mastercard-api.properties in resources folder. This properties file defines default endpoint URL and partner for API calls. It also has some other fields which are required for authentication.  

As part of the [Mastercard Developers Account](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) setup (as described in pre-requisites section above), you will also get the consumer key, keyalias and password. Set these values in mastercard-api.properties.   
* Example

```Example
mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.keyFile=classpath:key.p12

mastercard.api.authentication.consumerKey=YourConsumerKey

mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.keyalias=YourKeyAlias

mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.password=YourKeystorePassword
```

Set the following properties in the mastercard-api.properties file for MTLS (For Sandbox EU/UK domain testing, keep mTLS properties empty):
* Example

```Example
    
  mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.mtlsFile=yourPFXFile
  mastercard.api.authentication.keystore.mtlsPassword=yourPFXPassword

```

Please ensure you use the correct EU/UK endpoints by looking at respective API specifications. For your convenience, the below screenshots shows EU and UK examples respectively.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_config_1_uk.png)  

### e) Add resources {#e-add-resources}

* Open maven view in IDE and run maven clean and install. This will add dependencies to your project.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_prj_maven_upd.png)  

## Step 2: Executing the use cases {#step-2-executing-the-use-cases}

* Open the README.md in the reference application and read through the use cases to understand Cross-Border Service API functionality.   
* To test Quotes API, open QuotesAPITest.java, right click on any of the use case and click on run. It will execute that use case.   
  Please note, input for every use case is setup in CrossBorderAPITestHelper.java. Cross-Border Service APIs supports both XML and Json.

Note: Request Token generation is implicitly handled in the code base using Consumer Key, P12 File, Signing Key Alias \& Signing Key Password.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/ref_app_tutorial_prj_use_case.png)
You may similarly test all the APIs by executing the usecases listed in the respective xxxxTest.java file.  

### ++Encryption:++ {#uencryptionu}

* Cross-Border Services application requires payload encryption. To know details about encryption, go through [Enabling encryption](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md).   
  **You may contact [support](mailto:APISupport@mastercard.com) to get required keys and files for the same**   

To encrypt / decrypt request and response payloads, set properties in mastercard-api.properties.
* Example

```Example
mastercard.api.environment.runWithEncryptedPayload=true

mastercard.api.encryption.certificateFile=classpath:YourCertFile.crt 

mastercard.api.encryption.fingerPrint=YourFingerPrint 

mastercard.api.decryption.keyFile=classpath:YourKeyFile.key 

```

Note:   

**.crt file** must be extracted using the .pem file that can be downloaded from your [Project page](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) by clicking on the project and using the **Actions \> Download Encryption Key** under the Client Encryption Keys section.   

**.key file** is the .p12 file downloaded at time of encryption key creation.

#### Some recommendations: {#some-recommendations}

These are just recommendations. You are not required to use open ssl but may use any favorable tool.

* ++Creating **.cert file** from **.pem file**++:

  * Encryption_cert_generation

  ```Encryption_cert_generation
  openssl x509 -outform der -in ./MastercardSendCrossBorderClientEncxxxxxxxxxx.pem -out ./MastercardSendCrossBorderClientEncxxxxxxxxx.crt

  ```

  <br />

* ++Decrypting response payload using private key++:

* Decryption_key_generation

```Decryption_key_generation
openssl pkcs12 -in keyalias-encryption-mc.p12 -nocerts -out <filename1>.key.pem --nodes
openssl rsa -in <filename1>.key.pem -out <filename2>.text.pem --text
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER -in <filename2>.text.pem -out <filename3>.key --nocrypt

```

# Quotes API
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/quotes-api/index.md

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information. Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, refer the [Quotes API specifications for EU](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-quotes-api/index.md) and [Quotes API specification for UK](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-quotes-api/index.md) section respectively to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

Calculates for **configured service corridors** , the amount Senders should fund or Recipients will receive for a payment, depending on the Transaction Instruction.  

* The calculation uses the applicable Mastercard FX Rate and Mastercard Transaction Fees to determine the Settlement Amount.  
* A Quote response is informational only and does not initiate the movement of funds.  
* A Proposal ID returned with a Quote can be associated with a Payment to ensure the information obtained with the Quote is utilized for the Payment Transaction.

<br />

If you opt-in for Quote confirmation suite, you will receive 'ConfirmationExpiry time' in the API response.  

See [Payment with Quote](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/payment-with-quote/index.md) to understand how you can use Quote API with a payment transaction.

## Environment Domains {#environment-domains}

* Sandbox/MTF
* Production

```Sandbox/MTF
https://sandbox.api.mastercard.com/send/v1/partners/{partner-id}/crossborder/quotes
```

```Production
https://api.mastercard.com/send/v1/partners/{partner-id}/crossborder/quotes
```

Note: **Sandbox** and **MTF** environments share the same url but are differentiated by partner id.

## API {#api}

[**Open Specification**](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/cross-border-swagger.yaml)

## API Convention {#api-convention}

Take a look at the [API Conventions](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-conventions/index.md) for general guidelines.

## Payload Encryption {#payload-encryption}

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the payload sent by  
Mastercard.  

For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)

## Sandbox Testing {#sandbox-testing}

You can make API calls to the Sandbox server from your application code using the [tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md), which involves creating a Mastercard Developers project and using the Sandbox keys to generate the required Authorization Header.
Tip: During the onboarding process, Mastercard will assign a registered partner ID to test in the higher environments (MTF Test and Production). This partner ID will not be able to access the sandbox environment, but the customer can still access sandbox by using the non-registered partner ID.   
Any correctly formatted partner ID can be used in the sandbox. As a best practice, use the first 15 digits of your institution's name (alphanumeric and/or special characters, no spaces) as the Partner_ID.   
For testing in sandbox, please use unique transaction_reference on each run. Note: The sandbox does not return parameters unique to a specific Customer; such as pricing, limits, and corridor-specific data requirements, but allows you to test general call structure and responses outside of the production environment. After sandbox testing is completed, Customers meeting the eligibility requirements will be assigned a project manager to do integrated testing in the test environment that has been configured to include requested receiving corridors, current foreign exchange rates, and fixed and variable fees specific to the Customer.

# Quote Confirmation APIs
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/quote-confirmation-apis/index.md

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information. Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, please proceed to [Quotes Confirmation API Specifications for EU](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-quote-confirmation-apis/index.md) and [Quotes Confirmation API Specification for UK](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-quote-confirmation-apis/index.md) respectively to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

## API {#api}

[****Open Specification****](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/quoteapi_swagger.yaml)

Enrolling in the Quote Confirmation Service includes the following APIs:   

Note: If you would like real time Payment and Quote status updates then enroll in the [Status Change Push](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/status-change-api/index.md).

### Quote Confirmation API {#quote-confirmation-api}

This API is used to confirm the FX rate quote that you received in the Quotes API. This confirmation is mandatory prior to submitting a payment transaction. The Quote Confirmation needs to be done within the 'confirmationExpiryTime' that is received in the Quotes API response.
Getting a successful Quote Confirmation incurs a reserve of funds.  

If you opt-in 'Late Quote Confirmation policy' and you confirm the quote after `confirmationExpiryTime`, the original quote will be considered as 'Expired' and new quote will be sent in the Quote Confirmation API response. You can now confirm the new quote within the `ConfirmationExpirytime`. The late confirmation will be allowed for maximum of three (3) attempts; afterwards, the confirmation will be declined.

API Reference: `GET /send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/quotes/confirmations`

### Cancel Confirmed Quote API {#cancel-confirmed-quote-api}

This API is used to cancel a confirmed FX rate quote/proposal. If Confirmed Quote cancellation is sent before the payment initiation, the cancellation will result in return of reserved funds. If cancellation is sent after payment initiation, the Confirmed Quote Cancellation will be declined.

API Reference: `GET /send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/quotes/cancellations`

### Retrieve Confirmed Quote API {#retrieve-confirmed-quote-api}

If you opt-in in Quote Confirmation Suite, you can use this API to retrieve quote details requested for payment utilization.

API Reference: `GET /send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/quotes/{transaction_reference}/proposals/{proposal_id}`

## API Convention {#api-convention}

Take a look at the [API Conventions](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-conventions/index.md) for general guidelines.

## Payload Encryption {#payload-encryption}

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the payload sent by  
Mastercard.  

For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)

## Sandbox Testing {#sandbox-testing}

You can make API calls to the Sandbox server from your application code using the [tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md), which involves creating a Mastercard Developers project and using the Sandbox keys to generate the required OAuth 1.0a Authorization Header.
Tip: During the onboarding process, Mastercard will assign a registered partner ID to test in the higher environments (MTF Test and Production). This partner ID will not be able to access the sandbox environment, but the customer can still access sandbox by using the non-registered partner ID.   
Any correctly formatted partner ID can be used in the sandbox. As a best practice, use the first 15 digits of your institution's name (alphanumeric and/or special characters, no spaces) as the Partner_ID.   
For testing in sandbox, please use unique transaction_reference on each run. Note: The sandbox does not return parameters unique to a specific Customer; such as pricing, limits, and corridor-specific data requirements, but allows you to test general call structure and responses outside of the production environment. After sandbox testing is completed, Customers meeting the eligibility requirements will be assigned a project manager to do integrated testing in the test environment that has been configured to include requested receiving corridors, current foreign exchange rates, and fixed and variable fees specific to the Customer.

### Sandbox Test cases {#sandbox-test-cases}

The Sandbox server returns simulated, static responses. You can use the following test cases to produce specific responses.

# Payment with Quote
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/payment-with-quote/index.md

Payment with Quote allows associating the FX rate and amounts calculated for a previously submitted quote, to the payment.   
For the complete list of supported transaction types, see [Use Cases.](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/index.md)

The pricing model that you follow will help determine the type of the API call that you will use, the content you will send inside the API call, and the timing of when FX rates are retrieved. Learn more about the [Pricing Model](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/pricing-model/index.md).
Note: A valid single quote is for one-time use only i.e. it can be used for a single transaction.

Payment with quote can be achieved in three different ways:

## 1. Forward Payment (fees included) with quote {#1-forward-payment-fees-included-with-quote}

In this type, the sender specifies the Sending amount and currency for a payment including any applicable service fees and the amount received by recipient in the receiver currency is calculated.

##### ++Customer Managed Sender Pricing (CSMP) for an Originating Institution flow++: {#ucustomer-managed-sender-pricing-csmp-for-an-originating-institution-flowu}

The below sequence diagram shows a forward payment of 100 USD to Phillippines (including the service fees) with a quote, in a [CMSP](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/pricing-model/index.md) model.  

**Note**: The Originating Institution (OI) gets the rates from Cross-Border Services ahead of time and feeds into their system either using carded rates mechanism or Quotes API. This flow is not shown in the below diagram. For this example, let's assume the FX rate for USD to PHP conversion provided by Mastercard is 50 and service fees is 2 USD.
Diagram send-fwd-with-quote-fees-cmsp-sequence

##### ++Mastercard Managed Sender Pricing (MMSP) for an Originating Institution flow++: {#umastercard-managed-sender-pricing-mmsp-for-an-originating-institution-flowu}

The below sequence diagram shows a forward payment of 100 USD to Phillippines (including the service fees) with a quote, in a [MMSP](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/pricing-model/index.md) model.  
Diagram send-fwd-with-quote-fees-mmsp-sequence

## 2. Forward Payment(fees not included) with quote {#2-forward-paymentfees-not-included-with-quote}

In this type, the sender specifies the Sending amount and currency for a payment and the amount received by the end recipient and also the amount charged to the sender with the service fees applied on top of the request send amount is calculated.

##### ++Customer Managed Sender Pricing (CMSP) for an Originating Institution flow++: {#ucustomer-managed-sender-pricing-cmsp-for-an-originating-institution-flowu}

The below sequence shows a forward payment transaction of 100 USD to Phillippines as and the service fees applied on top of the sending amount; with a quote, in a [CMSP](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/pricing-model/index.md) model.  

**Note**: The Originating Institution (OI) gets the rates from Cross-Border Services ahead of time and feeds into their system either using carded rates mechanism or Quotes API. This flow is not shown in the below diagram. For this example, let's assume the FX rate for USD to PHP conversion provided by Mastercard is 50 and service fees is 2 USD.

##### ++Mastercard Managed Sender Pricing (MMSP) for an Originating Institution flow++: {#umastercard-managed-sender-pricing-mmsp-for-an-originating-institution-flowu-1}

The below sequence shows a forward payment transaction of 100 USD to Phillippines as and the service fees applied on top of the sending amount; with a quote, in a [MMSP](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/pricing-model/index.md) model.  
Diagram send-fwd-with-quote-wo-fees-mmsp-sequence

## 3. Reverse Payment with quote {#3-reverse-payment-with-quote}

Here, the receiving amount in receiver currency is specified by the sender and the total amount charged to the sender is calculated.

##### ++Customer Managed Sender Pricing (CMSP) for an Originating Institution flow++: {#ucustomer-managed-sender-pricing-cmsp-for-an-originating-institution-flowu-1}

The below sequence shows a payment transaction of 5000 PHP as a reverse payment based on the quote, in [CMSP](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/use-cases/pricing-model/index.md) model.   

**Note**: The Originating Institution (OI) gets the rates from Cross-Border Services ahead of time and feeds into their system either using carded rates mechanism or Quotes API. This flow is not shown in the below diagram. For this example, let's assume the FX rate for USD to PHP conversion provided by Mastercard is 50 and service fees is 2 USD.

## 4. Payment with Quote Confirmation {#4-payment-with-quote-confirmation}

Here, the Originating Institution (OI) has to confirm the quote that they receive in the quote API within the time specified in the quote APIs response.

##### ++Confirm Quote API for an Originating Institution flow++: {#uconfirm-quote-api-for-an-originating-institution-flowu}

# Person-to-person transfers
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/experience-design-guide/person-to-person-transfers/index.md

P2P transfers enable individuals to transfer funds to another person, such as sending money to family abroad and contributing to a friend's wedding gift, or transfer funds to personal savings.

We have included several tools to help you design a best-in-class experience for P2P transfers: a reference prototype that brings the experience to life, a Figma file including end-to-end product experience journeys, and flow diagrams for each moment of the experience.

# RFI APIs
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/index.md

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information.

Request for Information, commonly referred to as "RFI", is the process Cross-Border Services uses to enable information to be requested by a Receiving Service Provider (RSP), and responses to be shared between a Customer and RSP.   

For more details, please see [How it Works](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/how-it-works/index.md).

## Open a Request {#open-a-request}

Information is requested when information is needed to continue processing a payment. One RFI request can be created for **one or more payment** transactions.

## Request Status {#request-status}

After a request is created, it is in an Open status and assigned to a Customer for response. After a response is submitted by Customer, the information is reviewed by the Mastercard RFI Team ("RFI Team"). As a request goes through its workflow, the status will indicate its progress. Once no additional information is needed, the request is closed.  


The requestStatus determines the next action for the Customer. When requestStatus is OPEN or INPROGRESS, the Customer is expected to respond back to the request.  


The RFI Team may Cancel a request at any time. If this happens, the Customer receives a notification and the RFI status will change to Cancelled.  


Statuses are provided in the table below:

|   Status   |                                                                                 Description                                                                                  |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OPEN       | The request is assigned to a Customer. The Customer needs to respond to the request.                                                                                         |
| REVIEW     | The RFI Team is assigned to review the received Customer response.                                                                                                           |
| INPROGRESS | The RFI Team requires additional information. The RFI has been reassigned to the Customer and the Customer needs to respond with the amendments or additional information.   |
| CLOSED     | The RFI Team reviewed and approved the request responses, and the request is now complete. Or, no response was received within 15 calendar days and the request has expired. |
| CANCELLED  | The RFI Team cancelled a request because the information was no longer required.                                                                                             |

## RFI Push Notifications {#rfi-push-notifications}

When a RFI request is created, the Customer receives a webhook notification. Notifications will be dispatched as the request is updated, informing the Customer of any changes or pending actions. Depending on the information added or requested, a Customer might have to complete one or more actions from the below tables to respond.

## RFI Response review and request closure {#rfi-response-review-and-request-closure}

The RFI Team will review the additional information provided by the Customer. If all the information is approved, then the RFI will transition to a **Closed status** . When Closed, no further activity is required for the request. The request remains available in read-only mode.  

The RFI Team may require additional information to the original details provided. If this occurs, the request will be re-assigned to the Customer. The Customer receives a webhook notification with requestStatus =**InProgress** . The Customer will be informed of the rejected response data, or additional information required. Review comments may be added indicating why the information was rejected, and what additional information is required. The Customer is required to edit the rejected information and submit an updated response, after which the RFI will transition to **Review** status, and the review workflow will begin once again.

# Cancel Payment API
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/cancel-payment-api/index.md

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information. Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, please proceed to [Cancel Payment API Specifications for EU](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-cancel-payment-api/index.md) and [Cancel Payment API Specification for UK](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-cancel-payment-api/index.md) respectively to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

## Environment Domains {#environment-domains}

* Sandbox/MTF
* Production

```Sandbox/MTF
https://sandbox.api.mastercard.com/send/v1/partners/{partner-id}/crossborder/{payment-id}/cancel
```

```Production
https://api.mastercard.com/send/v1/partners/{partner-id}/crossborder/{payment-id}/cancel
```

Note: **Sandbox** and **MTF** environments share the same url but are differentiated by partner id.

You can use this API to cancel a request for a transaction that is in PENDING status.
Any payment with a payment status as "Pending" and Pending Stage as "Insufficient Balance" can be cancelled.
Additionally, for cash-out and some mobile money providers, the payment with status "Pending" can be cancelled irrespective of the Pending stage of that payment.

## API {#api}

[**++Open Specification++**](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/cross-border-swagger.yaml)

Alternatively, here is a tabular view of the request/ response parameter:
[Cancel_Payment_Specifications.pdf](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Cancel_Payment_Specifications.pdf) (349KB)   


API Reference: `GET /send/v1/partners/{partner-id}/crossborder/{payment-id}/cancel`

* **Formats supported** : XML/ JSON   
* **HTTP Version**: 1.0/ 1.1
* **Required HTTP header parameters** :   
  content-type : Format of the inbound content being submitted. example: application/json   
  content-length: Length of the inbound content body in octets.   
  Accept: Format of the expected response must be provided in this header field. Example - application/json

## API Convention {#api-convention}

Take a look at the [API Conventions](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-conventions/index.md) for general guidelines.

## Payload Encryption {#payload-encryption}

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the payload sent by  
Mastercard.   

For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)

## Sandbox Testing {#sandbox-testing}

You can make API calls to the Sandbox server from an API tool, your application code using the [tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md), which involves creating a Mastercard Developers project and using the Sandbox keys to generate the required Authorization Header.
Tip: During the onboarding process, Mastercard will assign a registered partner ID to test in the higher environments (MTF Test and Production). This partner ID will not be able to access the sandbox environment, but the customer can still access sandbox by using the non-registered partner ID.  
Any correctly formatted partner ID can be used in the sandbox. As a best practice, use the first 15 digits of your institution's name (alphanumeric and/or special characters, no spaces) as the Partner_ID.   
For testing in sandbox, please use unique transaction_reference on each run. Note: The sandbox does not return parameters unique to a specific Customer; such as pricing, limits, and corridor-specific data requirements, but allows you to test general call structure and responses outside of the production environment. After sandbox testing is completed, Customers meeting the eligibility requirements will be assigned a project manager to do integrated testing in the test environment that has been configured to include requested receiving corridors, current foreign exchange rates, and fixed and variable fees specific to the Customer.

### Sandbox Test cases {#sandbox-test-cases}

The Sandbox server returns simulated, static responses. You can use the following test cases to produce specific responses.

| Status  |                                 Test Case                                  |                                              Action                                               |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Success | Cancel Payment Response is "Success" indicating the Request was delivered. | Send a Cancel Payment populating the transaction reference ID or payment ID of a pending payment. |

**Note** : For test scenarios to make a Payment API call, please look at the **Sandbox Test cases** section [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/payment-api/index.md).
A payment can be cancelled only if the payment transaction is in **pending** status.

# Endpoint Guide API
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/endpoint-guide-adapter_api/index.md

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information. Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, please proceed to [Endpoint Guide API Specifications for EU](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-endpoint-guide-adapter-api/index.md) and [Endpoint Guide Adapter API Specifications for UK](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-endpoint-guide-adapter-api/index.md) respectively to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

The Endpoint Guide API serves as a comprehensive reference for retrieving configuration and operational details across all payment corridors. It provides structured information on both mandatory and optional request parameters, tailored to specific endpoint attributes such as destination currency, destination country, payment instrument, and payment type.

The API categorizes data into:

1. Core data: Core request fields to be provided in the payment/quote request.
2. Additional data: Optional or conditional fields required by the system for successful transaction processing or compliance and regulatory purposes.

This design ensures that integrators and partners can dynamically adapt their requests based on corridor-specific requirements, improving accuracy and reducing integration effort.
Tip: The API call should not be integrated in the Payment API. It is recommended to cache the endpoint guide specifications and refresh them once a week for better system performance. For any upcoming updates, please refer to the **Customer Notice** for **Payout Service Updates** to determine any additional refresh needed.

## Environment Domains {#environment-domains}

* Sandbox/MTF
* Production

```Sandbox/MTF
https://sandbox.api.mastercard.com/crossborder/endpoint-guide/specifications?payment_type={payment_type}&destination_country={destination_country}&destination_currency={destination_currency}&destination_payment_instrument={destination_payment_instrument}
```

```Production
https://api.mastercard.com/crossborder/endpoint-guide/specifications?payment_type={payment_type}&destination_country={destination_country}&destination_currency={destination_currency}&destination_payment_instrument={destination_payment_instrument}
```

Note: **Sandbox** and **MTF** environments share the same url but are differentiated by partner id. In the Sandbox environment, the technical rules will be governed by generic endpoints' setup. The API will provide the specific rules for the given corridor after the customer has been onboarded. Hence, there is a possibility of differences in the rules across Sandbox and MTF environments.

## API {#api}

[**++Open Specification++**](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/endpoint-guide-adapter-swagger.yaml)

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information. Alert: If you are an Originating Institution contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, please proceed to [Validation Services Specifications for EU](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-validation-services-api/index.md) and [Validation Services Specification for UK](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-validation-services-api/index.md) respectively to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

## API {#api}

[**Open Specification**](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/bank_account_validation_swagger_V2.yaml)

### Account Validation API {#account-validation-api}

<br />

The Account Validation API is a feature within Validation Services which allows Customers to validate Recipient account information before submitting payment to Cross-Border Services.

<br />

Customers deciding to code to this API will receive successful or rejection responses based on Receiving Account data provided for a specific corridor.
This API functionality has been expanded to provide additional services including:

* IBAN Validation Service -- Customers can validate account format and structure of an IBAN value provided for payload instruction.
* Card Eligibility Service -- Customers can validate debit or credit card account number format and structure. In addition, customers can receive payload feedback if an account can support cross-border transactions.

<br />

Please note, while Cross-Border Services provide account validation and verification services to help customers verify recipient account information; this does not guarantee payment transactions will be accepted or processed at the recipient's financial institution. The financial institution hosting the Recipient's account can reject or return funds to the sending institution for various reasons outside of Mastercard control.

API Reference: `GET /{partner_id}/crossborder/accounts/validations`

##### Account Validation Push Notification {#account-validation-push-notification}

Customers who code for the Card Eligibility Service receives a push notification after the Account Validation API finishes processing, if the initial response returned an `IN_PROGRESS` status.


API Reference: `GET /webhooks`

<br />

<br />

### IBAN Generation API {#iban-generation-api}

<br />

The IBAN Generation API is a feature within Validation services which allows customers to generate IBAN account values using several bank identifying data elements.

Customers deciding to code to this API, would receive successful or rejection responses based on data elements used to create requested IBAN value. Some elements which are supported within this API are country, branch code and SWIFT BIC values.

API Reference: `GET /{partner_id}/crossborder/accounts/generate-ibans`

### Bank Information LookUp API {#bank-information-lookup-api}

<br />

The Bank Information Lookup API is a feature within Validation services which allows customers to retrieve specific details of beneficiary bank which may be used for payment transaction.

Customers deciding to code to this API, can use bank related details such as bank name, bank address and bank code to obtain full bank identifying information for a specific branch within a desired country.

API Reference: `GET /{partner_id}/crossborder/banks/details`

* **Formats supported** : JSON   
* **HTTP Version**: 1.0/ 1.1
* **Required HTTP header parameters** :   
  content-type : Format of the inbound content being submitted. example: application/json   
  accept: Format of the inbound content being submitted. example: application/json   
  X-Mc-Correlation-Id : A unique correlation ID for tracking the request.   
  Partner-Ref-Id : A unique reference ID of the business partner.

## API Convention {#api-convention}

Take a look at the [API Conventions](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-conventions/index.md) for general guidelines.

## Payload Encryption {#payload-encryption}

All payload request sent to and from Cross-Border Services are encrypted.   

For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)

## Sandbox Testing {#sandbox-testing}

You can make API calls to the Sandbox server from your application code using the [tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md), which involves creating a Mastercard Developers project and using the Sandbox keys to generate the required Authorization Header.
Tip: During the onboarding process, Mastercard will assign a registered partner ID to test in the higher environments (MTF Test and Production). This partner ID will not be able to access the sandbox environment, but the customer can still access sandbox by using the non-registered partner ID.   
Any correctly formatted partner ID can be used in the sandbox. As a best practice, use the first 15 digits of your institution's name (alphanumeric and/or special characters, no spaces) as the Partner_ID.   
For testing in sandbox, please use unique transaction_reference on each run. Note: The sandbox does not return parameters unique to originating institutions; such as pricing, limits, and corridor-specific data requirements, but allows you to test general call structure and responses outside of the production environment. After sandbox testing is completed, customers meeting the eligibility requirements will be assigned a project manager to do integrated testing in the test environment that has been configured to include requested receiving corridors, current foreign exchange rates, and fixed and variable fees specific to the Originating Institution.

### Sandbox Test cases {#sandbox-test-cases}

Alert: For the Validation Services requests initiated in the Sandbox/MTF url must use the test cases specified in the following table. Please limit your testing requirements only to test cases available below.

The Sandbox server returns simulated, static responses. You can use the following test cases to produce specific responses.

# Push Notifications Details
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/push-notifications-details/index.md

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information.

Mastercard Cross-Border Services offers the following push notifications as opt-in Services:

1. [Status Change Push](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/status-change-api/index.md)  
2. [Carded Rate Push](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/carded-rate-api/index.md)  
3. [RFI Push](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/notification/index.md)  
4. [Validation Services Push](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/validation-services-api/index.md#account-validation-api)  

Mastercard Cross-Border Services expects HTTP Response Code 200 for all push notifications. In the event of a timeout or error, Mastercard Cross-Border Services will resend the notification with a maximum of three retries. This ould unknowingly cause duplicate notifications. So Mastercard Cross-Border Services recommends Customer to build logic in their systems to identify the `eventRef` and ignore any duplicate notifications with the same `eventRef`.

## Push Notification Setup {#push-notification-setup}

* Push APIs involve a Mutual Secure Connection to be established between Mastercard and the External partner server which exposes the webhook endpoint (URL). This is achieved through Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication method.

### Step 1: Provide Push API Notification Webhook URL {#step-1-provide-push-api-notification-webhook-url}

You will provide the Webhook URL for both the MTF and the PROD environments. The Webhook URLs must be active on your network.
Mastercard API Gateway (APIGW) does not perform any connectivity check explicitly after onboarding your Webhook. You should confirm your domain is getting pinged from the internet before submitting Webhook URL.

**Follow the below guidelines for the endpoint URL.**

* You should provide endpoint URL.
* The URL needs to be public and reachable on internet.
* It needs to be FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) and HTTPS.
* The domain name should be resolvable and webhook should not be created with IP.
* The URL should end with /Webhook -- no other query parameter in URL or header is allowed/required.   
  Ex: Not accepted: api.fakecompany.com/?id=xxx.   
  Ex: Accepted : api.fakecompany.com/xbs/status/webhook.
* You should not create a webhook expecting Oauth token to be sent.
* You should not create a webhook waiting for a POST parameter containing the api-key (fixed value).
* Mastercard supports different destination paths for push notifications in both mtf and production environments.

Note: Mastercard does not recommend using IP address allow-listing as a security measure for inbound or outbound services. This method is not seen as robust or scalable for securing webhook communications or API integrations. However, if your organization needs the list of outbound IP addresses used by the API Gateway for firewall configuration, your Mastercard Customer Implementation Services (CIS) Representative can provide these details upon request.

### Step 2: Exchange certificate {#step-2-exchange-certificate}

#### Configuration Details {#configuration-details}

Note:   
* Use these configuration details only with options 1 and 2 when a Mastercard-issued client certificate is used in the MTLS flow for push notifications.
* For option 3, you must define the Distinguished Name (DN) and Mastercard creates the CSR according to those requirements, as the client certificate will be issued by your Certificate Authority (CA).

Partners and customers using Mastercard products or services via push notifications to partner webhook endpoints should refer to the following certificate Distinguished Name (DN):

* **Member Test Facility (MTF)** :-CN=CrossborderServicesNotification-mtf.mastercard.com, OU=admin, O=MasterCard International Incorporated, L=Waterloo, C=BE
* **Production** :-CN=CrossborderServicesNotification-prod.mastercard.com, OU=admin, O=MasterCard International Incorporated, L=Waterloo, C=BE

#### Option 1: CA Trust method for the MTLS {#option-1-ca-trust-method-for-the-mtls}

Mastercard certificate authority (CA) is DigiCert. If you trust all certificates issued by DigiCert as CA, there are no action required by you. In this case, you should already be trusting the DigiCert CA Chain that has signed Mastercard domain certificate.

You can download the outbound DigiCert CA certificates directly from the [CA website](https://www.digicert.com/kb/digicert-root-certificates.htm#roots:~:text=0F%3AFA%3AE1%3AF3%3A1A%3A2B%3A43%3A3C%3A3D%3A9A%3AE1%3A6D%3A64%3A3B%3A58%3A8B):

* /C=US/O=DigiCert Inc/CN=DigiCert Assured ID Client CA G2
* /C=US/O=DigiCert Inc/OU=www.digicert.com/CN= DigiCert Assured ID Root G2

Note:   
* If necessary, Mastercard can also share the CA certificates with you through the Key Management Portal in Mastercard Connect.
* As pre-requisite, you must have access to the Key management portal (KMP) in Mastercard Connect and must have registered the KMP security officers through the same application.
* The Inbound and Outbound CA certificates are different. Inbound CA certificates are used for services initiated by the customer to Mastercard, while Outbound CA certificates are used for services initiated by Mastercard to the customer. The DigiCert CA certificates used by Mastercard are:
  * Inbound: DigiCert Global G2 TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1 and DigiCert Global Root G2
  * Outbound: DigiCert Assured ID Client CA G2 and DigiCert Assured ID Root G2 1

#### Option 2: Non-standard MTLS validation {#option-2-non-standard-mtls-validation}

Note: Mastercard recommends using option 1 from the given options for the issued certificate.

A non-standard MTLS validation such as certificate pinning or to locally store the end-entity client certificate for infrastructure requirement, requires Mastercard to share the full CA chain with the customer including the Mastercard client leaf certificate.

1. The CIS implementation representative initiates the request for the key exchange process to the Mastercard Key Management team only after ensuring that the customer can access the KMP portal and can register their KMP security officers.

2. After the key exchange over KMP, you need to download and configure the CA certificates in addition to the Mastercard client certificate in your server trust store for a successful mTLS authentication for outbound services.

3. Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/push-api-notification-mtls-setup/index.md) to push the API Notification Mutual TLS setup.

#### Option 3: Third-Party certificates handling process {#option-3-third-party-certificates-handling-process}

If your infrastructure does not support external Certificate Authorities (CAs) like DigiCert for inclusion in your trust store, and instead relies on your own designated CAs to authenticate server connections for outbound communication, then follow these steps for handeling the third-party certificates:

1. Reach out to the Mastercard implementation representative with a request to allow own preferred CAs for authentication.
2. The representative works internally to request handling of the third party client certificates.
3. Once approved, you will get an email from the Key Management team within Mastercard to proceed.
4. Login to KMP and download the CSR.
5. Provide the client certificate signed by your Third-Party CA in the same KMP portal.

<br />

Once the configuration is completed, your Mastercard implementation representative informs you to proceed with the testing phase.

## How to identify {#how-to-identify}

Contact your organization technical team (IT support or operations) that support your servers or APIs that Mastercard connects to and ask them to confirm whether your middleware is configured for the CA Trust method of validating mutually authenticated transport layer security (mTLS) for API's, or if the existing certificates are located in the trust store of your servers.
If your middleware does require end-entity certificates to be stored in the trust store, then add (import) the new previously mentioned certificates into your trust store as additional valid certificates.

When using OpenAPI Generator to generate the API client library, you have two options:

* Generate and use the source files on the fly
* Generate and deploy the source files to a Maven repository In this tutorial, you will be generating the API client library on the fly, so you include the dependencies that are needed to generate the library. (If you were deploying the source files to a Maven repository, you would only need to include the dependency for that repository.)

## Step 2: Generating the API Client SDK {#step-2-generating-the-api-client-sdk}

### a) Generate Sources {#a-generate-sources}

Now that you have all the dependencies you need, you can generate the sources.

In IntelliJ IDEA, open the window for Maven (View \> Tool Windows \> Maven).
Click the icons for Reimport All Maven Projects and Generate Sources and Update Folders for All Projects:

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_api_tutorial_generate_sources1.png)

### b) Generate the SDK {#b-generate-the-sdk}

You should now be ready to generate the API client library.

In the same menu, navigate to the commands ({Project name} \> Lifecycle), run clean and then compile. Alternatively, you can navigate to the root directory of the project within a terminal window and run mvn clean compile.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_api_tutorial_generate_sources2.png)

Afterwards, there should be a new folder named target, within your root directory, which contains classes generated for the schemas and API calls defined within the OpenAPI Specification. The generated classes can be found in target folder as shown below.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/tutorial_target_folder.png)

## Step 3: Making API Call (Encrypted payload) {#step-3-making-api-call-encrypted-payload}

Make sure you have below dependency added to your pom.xml file for Encryption.

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.mastercard.developer</groupId>
            <artifactId>client-encryption</artifactId>
            <version>1.6.0</version>
        </dependency>

Create a Java file, called Main.java, at src/main/java/.

To make an API call with encrypted payload, you need to make your OAuth credentials and Encryption keys available to the program to use:
* Oauth

```Oauth
String token = "Bearer <your access token>";
client.addDefaultHeader("Authorization", token);

String decryptionKeyFilePath = "/path/to/your/key.p12";
String decryptionKeyAlias = "your decryption key alias";
String decryptionKeyPassword = "your decryption password";
PrivateKey decryptionKey = EncryptionUtils.loadDecryptionKey(decryptionKeyFilePath, decryptionKeyAlias, decryptionKeyPassword)
String encryptionCertPath = "/path/to/your/CrossBorderServicesEnc.pem";
```

Next, you instantiate a client that you can set up to sign requests that you send with your authentication credentials.
* Client_Instantiation

```Client_Instantiation
ApiClient client = new ApiClient();
client.setBasePath("/path/to/your/domainURL");
client.setDebugging(true);
client.setReadTimeout(40000);

// for mTLS connection (For Sandbox EU/UK domain testing, do not keep below configurations)
KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS12");
char[] password= "yourPfxPassword".toCharArray();

keystore.load((new FileInputStream("/path/to/your/pfxFile")),password);

SSLContextBuilder builder = new SSLContextBuilder();
builder.loadTrustMaterial(null, new TrustSelfSignedStrategy());
builder.loadKeyMaterial(keystore, "yourPfxPassword".toCharArray());
SSLContext sslContext = builder.build();

SSLSocketFactory sf = sslContext.getSocketFactory();
OkHttpClient httpClient = client.getHttpClient();
httpClient.setSslSocketFactory(sf);
client.addDefaultHeader("Content-Type", "application/json; charset=UTF-8");
client.setHttpClient(httpClient);

List<Interceptor> interceptors = client.getHttpClient().interceptors();

List<Interceptor> interceptors = client.getHttpClient().interceptors();
        interceptors.add(new ForceJsonResponseInterceptor());
        JweConfig config = JweConfigBuilder.aJweEncryptionConfig()
                .withEncryptionCertificate(EncryptionUtils.
                        loadEncryptionCertificate("/path/to/your/.pem"))
                .withEncryptionPath("$", "$.encrypted_payload")
                .withEncryptedValueFieldName("data")
                .withDecryptionKey(EncryptionUtils.loadDecryptionKey("/path/to/your/encryption-key.p12"
                        , "yourKeyAlias", "yourPassword"))
                .withDecryptionPath("$.encrypted_payload.data", "$")
                .build();
        interceptors.add(OkHttp2JweInterceptor.from(config));
        client.addDefaultHeader("x-encrypted","true");
RetrieveAccountBalancesApi retrieveAccountBalancesApi = new RetrieveAccountBalancesApi(client);   
        
```

The interceptor that you use to sign requests is also provided by the Mastercard OAuth library.

With your environment set up, you can start to build a request.
Any nested objects within the Request Body have each been assigned a wrapper class, and so in order to build the request, you will be instantiating multiple objects and ultimately wrapping those with the main request object.
You make the Encrypted API call, parse the response payload and store it into a Response object.
Once you have the response stored, you have different options, but for this tutorial you can simply use toString to print the response body.  

To make it easy to understand, only the snippets needed to make the API call is shown above. The full content of Main.java is shown below.

# API Tutorial for Request Token Based OAuth2.0
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/oauth2-api-sdk-tutorial-request-token/index.md

###### Time to complete: *20 minutes* {#time-to-complete-20-minutes}

If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, you must connect to the Mastercard Cross-Border Services APIs using [Request Token based OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).   

## Introduction {#introduction}

This tutorial creates a simple Java program to generate an API client library with OpenAPI Generator and the Mastercard Cross-Border Service APIs Specification. This uses Request Token based OAuth2.0 authentication mechanism to demonstrate how to  

a) make an API call to the Mastercard Cross-Border Services **Payment API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-payment-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-payment-api/index.md)) and   

b) retrieves the payment transaction by making another call to **Retrieve Payment API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-retrieve-payment-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-retrieve-payment-api/index.md)) in the Sandbox environment.

You may extend this to other Cross-Border Services APIs as well.

The tutorial includes generating an API client library with OpenAPI Generator and using the Mastercard Cross-Border Service APIs Specification.

During this tutorial, you will:

1. Add appropriate resources to your project
2. Add proper dependencies
3. Generate the API Client SDK
4. Make API Call

## Step 1: Setting Up {#step-1-setting-up}

### a) Pre-requisites {#a-pre-requisites}

To complete this tutorial, you need:  

* Maven 3.6 or later
* JDK 1.8.0 or later
* IntelliJ IDEA (or any other IDE of your choice)
* [Mastercard Developers Account](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) with access to Mastercard Cross-Border Services API and the signing keys generated. You would require the .p12 file, consumer key, keyalias and password from this step to proceed with the below steps. (Click [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/guide-create-project/index.md) for a step by step guide on account setup.)  
* Mastercard Cross-Border Services Open API specification (Retrieve by clicking on the expandable section on the **Payment API** ([EU specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-payment-api/index.md)/ [UK specification](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-payment-api/index.md)).
* For Sandbox EU/UK domain testing, mTLS client certificate(.PKCS12 or .PFX file) is not needed. For MTF and PROD, connect with your local representative to get the mTLS certificates, to consume APIs.
* Checkout the maven project of Token Generation Utility from : <https://github.com/Mastercard/send-util-crossborder-oauth2>. Build JAR file crossborder-oauth2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar and add this jar file in project as dependency.

### b) Create a Maven Project {#b-create-a-maven-project}

In IntelliJ IDEA, create a new Maven project, which sets up your directory structure automatically.  
Provide ArtifactId and Project name.
Here we used the name 'cross_border_services_tutorial'. See below:

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_tutorial_new_prj_1.png)

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_tutorial_new_prj_2.png)

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_tutorial_new_prj_3.png)

### c) Add Resources {#c-add-resources}

Note: #4 and #5 below are only relevant if you want to use Encrypted Request payload, else feel free to skip these two steps.

1. Add the Mastercard Cross-Border Services API specification to your Maven project's resources folder.(Retrieve by clicking on the expandable section on the Payment API)
2. Add the generated p12 file to your Maven project's resources folder. (Generated by creating Sandbox Signing Key within your project in [Mastercard Developers](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard)
3. Add the Test mTLS client certificate (.PKCS12 or .PFX file) to your Maven project's resources folder. This file is not mandatory for sandbox.api.xbs.mastercard.eu/uk domains.
4. Add the generated Encryption p12 file to your Maven project's resources folder. (Generated by creating Mastercard Encryption Key within your project in [Mastercard Developers](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard)
5. Add the generated pem file to your Maven project's resources folder. (Downloaded from Client Encryption Keys section).

Your Maven project directory should look as follows:

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_tutorial_add_resources.png)

### d) Update pom.xml file {#d-update-pomxml-file}

1. Add the following plugin to your Maven project's pom.xml file to add OpenAPI Generator to your project.
   OpenAPI Generator generates API client libraries from OpenAPI Specifications (formerly known as Swagger files). OpenAPI Generator provides multiple generators and library templates to support multiple languages and frameworks. You will be using the java generator for this project.

When using OpenAPI Generator to generate the API client library, you have two options:

* Generate and use the source files on the fly
* Generate and deploy the source files to a Maven repository In this tutorial, you will be generating the API client library on the fly, so you include the dependencies that are needed to generate the library. (If you were deploying the source files to a Maven repository, you would only need to include the dependency for that repository.)

## Step 2: Generating the API Client SDK {#step-2-generating-the-api-client-sdk}

### a) Generate Sources {#a-generate-sources}

Now that you have all the dependencies you need, you can generate the sources.

In IntelliJ IDEA, open the window for Maven (View \> Tool Windows \> Maven).
Click the icons for Reimport All Maven Projects and Generate Sources and Update Folders for All Projects:

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_api_tutorial_generate_sources1.png)

### b) Generate the SDK {#b-generate-the-sdk}

You should now be ready to generate the API client library.

In the same menu, navigate to the commands ({Project name} \> Lifecycle), run clean and then compile. Alternatively, you can navigate to the root directory of the project within a terminal window and run mvn clean compile.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_api_tutorial_generate_sources2.png)

Now, there should be a new folder named target, within your root directory, which contains classes generated for the schemas and API calls defined within the OpenAPI Specification. The generated classes can be found in target folder as shown below.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/tutorial_target_folder.png)

## Step 3: Making API Call (Encrypted payload) {#step-3-making-api-call-encrypted-payload}

Make sure you have below dependency added to your pom.xml file for Encryption.

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.mastercard.developer</groupId>
            <artifactId>client-encryption</artifactId>
            <version>1.6.0</version>
        </dependency>

Create a Java file, called Main.java, at src/main/java/.

To make an API call with encrypted payload, you need to make your OAuth credentials and Encryption keys available to the program to use:
* Oauth

```Oauth
String consumerKey = "your consumer key";
String signingKeyFilePath = "/path/to/your/key.p12";
String signingKeyAlias = "your key alias";
String signingKeyPassword = "your password";
PrivateKey signingKey = AuthenticationUtils.loadSigningKey(signingKeyFilePath, signingKeyAlias, signingKeyPassword);
String decryptionKeyFilePath = "/path/to/your/key.p12";
String decryptionKeyAlias = "your decryption key alias";
String decryptionKeyPassword = "your decryption password";
PrivateKey decryptionKey = EncryptionUtils.loadDecryptionKey(decryptionKeyFilePath, decryptionKeyAlias, decryptionKeyPassword)
String encryptionCertPath = "/path/to/your/CrossBorderServicesEnc.pem";
```

Next, you instantiate a client that you can set up to sign requests that you send with your authentication credentials.
* Client_Instantiation

```Client_Instantiation
ApiClient client = new ApiClient();
client.setBasePath("https://sandbox.api.xbs.mastercard.eu");
client.setDebugging(true);
client.setReadTimeout(40000);
List<Interceptor> interceptors = client.getHttpClient().interceptors();
interceptors.add(new ForceJsonResponseInterceptor());
client.addDefaultHeader("x-encrypted","true"); // This header should be added for all Encryption calls.

JweConfig config = JweConfigBuilder.aJweEncryptionConfig()
            .withEncryptionCertificate(EncryptionUtils.
                    loadEncryptionCertificate(encryptionCertPath))
            .withEncryptionPath("$", "$.encrypted_payload") // This property should be kept as it is.
            .withEncryptedValueFieldName("data") // This property should be kept as it is.
            .withDecryptionKey(decryptionKey)
            .withDecryptionPath("$.encrypted_payload.data", "$") // This property should be kept as it is.
            .build();
interceptors.add(OkHttp2JweInterceptor.from(config)); // This interceptor should be added before OAuth Interceptor.
interceptors.add(new OkHttp2OAuth2Interceptor(signingKeyFilePath, signingKeyAlias, signingKeyPassword, consumerKey));
HttpLoggingInterceptor logger = new HttpLoggingInterceptor();
logger.setLevel(HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY);
interceptors.add(logger);
PaymentApi paymentApi = new PaymentApi(client);  
```

The interceptor that you use to sign requests is also provided by the Mastercard OAuth library.
* Interceptor

```Interceptor
private static class ForceJsonResponseInterceptor implements Interceptor {
        @Override
        public Response intercept(Chain chain) throws IOException {
            Request originalRequest = chain.request();
            String withJsonFormatUrl = withJsonFormat(originalRequest.uri().toString());
            Request newRequest = originalRequest.newBuilder().url(withJsonFormatUrl).build();
            return chain.proceed(newRequest);
        }

        private String withJsonFormat(String uri) {
            StringBuilder newUri = new StringBuilder(uri);
            newUri.append(uri.contains("?") ? "&" : "?");
            newUri.append("Format=JSON");
            return newUri.toString();
        }
    }

```

With your environment set up, you can start to build a request.
Any nested objects within the Request Body have each been assigned a wrapper class, and so in order to build the request, you will be instantiating multiple objects and ultimately wrapping those with the main request object.
You make the Encrypted API call, parse the response payload and store it into a Response object.
Once you have the response stored, you have different options, but for this tutorial you can simply use toString to print the response body.  

To make it easy to understand, only the snippets needed to make the API call is shown above. The full content of Main.java is shown below.

source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/response-error-codes/error-codes/index.md

For a complete list of transaction type specific error codes, refer
[error-and-return_codes_information.xlsx](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/error-and-return_codes_information.xlsx) (37KB)

The above attached error code document provides detailed information about the errors supported with both V3 and V4 error codes. This document also provides the scenario(s) in which the errors are expected to occur and relevant actions to be taken to resolve the issues.
Note: The document details if an error code is associated with v3 or v4 and or both. If any description changes are observed on a specific error between V3 and V4, the respective error code is displayed twice - each entity with explicit version and associated description.

### Column Descriptions: {#column-descriptions}

* **Code Value** - The error code provided in the Error.Value field.
* **Reason** - The error reason provided in the Error.ReasonCode field.
* **Code Description** - The description provided in the Error.Description field.
* **Scenario** - The scenario in which the error is likely to occur.
* **Action to Take** - The steps to be followed to resolve the error.
* **Relevant API** - The API/APIs that can trigger the error.
* **Error Code V3** - Represents the error versioning that supports the error code.
* **Error Code V4** - Represents the error versioning that supports the error code.
* **V4 Error Update Additional Details** - Provides the reason for the update to version 4 Error.
* **Return Message V3** - Indicates if the Code is possible for a Return as part of Version 3 Returns.

Tip: It's recommended that the applications be written such that any new error codes introduced will be backward compatible, avoiding negative impact.

###### Time to complete: *20 minutes* {#time-to-complete-20-minutes}

Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, you must connect using [OAuth2.0 Authorization Code flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-access-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for Balance APIs and [OAuth2.0 Request Token based flow](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/oauth2-request-token-based-authentication-details/index.md) for all APIs (except Balance API), as the authentication mechanism to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).  
Please proceed to the [API Tutorial for the Authorization Code based OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/oauth2-api-sdk-tutorial-access-token/index.md) and [API Tutorial for the Request Token based OAuth2.0](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/oauth2-api-sdk-tutorial-request-token/index.md) to learn about connecting to Mastercard Cross-Border Services APIs.

## Introduction {#introduction}

This tutorial creates a simple Java program that makes an API call to the Mastercard Cross-Border Services [Payment API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/payment-api/index.md) and retrieves the payment transaction by making another call to [Retrieve Payment API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/retrieve-payment-api/index.md) in the Sandbox environment. The tutorial includes generating an API client library with OpenAPI Generator and using the Mastercard Cross-Border Service Payments API Specification.

You may extend this to other Cross-Border Services APIs as well.

During this tutorial, you will:

1. Add appropriate resources to your project
2. Add proper dependencies
3. Generate the API Client SDK
4. Make API Call

## Step 1: Setting Up {#step-1-setting-up}

### a) Pre-requisites {#a-pre-requisites}

To complete this tutorial, you need:  

* Maven 3.6 or later
* JDK 1.8.0 or later
* IntelliJ IDEA (or any other IDE of your choice)
* [Mastercard Developers Account](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) with access to Cross-Border Services API. (Click [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/guide-create-project/index.md) for a step by step guide.)  
* Mastercard Cross-Border Services Open API specification (Retrieve by clicking on the expandable section on the [Payment API](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/payment-api/index.md)

### b) Create a Maven Project {#b-create-a-maven-project}

In IntelliJ IDEA, create a new Maven project, which sets up your directory structure automatically.  
Provide ArtifactId and Project name.
Here we used the name 'cross_border_services_tutorial'. See below:

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_tutorial_new_prj_1.png)

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_tutorial_new_prj_2.png)

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_tutorial_new_prj_3.png)

### c) Add Resources {#c-add-resources}

1. Add the Mastercard Cross-Border Services API specification to your Maven project's resources folder.(Retrieve by clicking on the expandable section on the Payment API)
2. Add the generated p12 file to your Maven project's resources folder. (Generated by creating Sandbox Signing Key within your project in [Mastercard Developers](https://developer.mastercard.com/)
3. Add the generated Encryption p12 file to your Maven project's resources folder. (Generated by creating Mastercard Encryption Key within your project in [Mastercard Developers](https://developer.mastercard.com/)
4. Add the generated pem file to your Maven project's resources folder. (Downloaded from Client Encryption Keys section).

Your Maven project directory should look as follows:

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_tutorial_add_resources.png)

### d) Update pom.xml file {#d-update-pomxml-file}

1. Add the following plugin to your Maven project's pom.xml file to add OpenAPI Generator to your project.
   OpenAPI Generator generates API client libraries from OpenAPI Specifications (formerly known as Swagger files). OpenAPI Generator provides multiple generators and library templates to support multiple languages and frameworks. You will be using the java generator for this project.

   * Plugin

   ```xml
       <build>
       <plugins>
           <plugin>
               <groupId>org.openapitools</groupId>
               <artifactId>openapi-generator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
               <version>3.3.4</version>
               <executions>
                   <execution>
                       <id>Cross-Border Services REST Client</id>
                       <goals>
                           <goal>generate</goal>
                       </goals>
                       <configuration>
                           <inputSpec>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/cross-border-swagger.yaml</inputSpec>
                           <generatorName>java</generatorName>
                           <configOptions>
                               <sourceFolder>src/gen/java/main</sourceFolder>
                               <hideGenerationTimestamp>true</hideGenerationTimestamp>
                           </configOptions>
                       </configuration>
                   </execution>
               </executions>
           </plugin>
       </plugins>
       </build>
       
   ```

2. Add the following dependencies to your pom.xml file to add dependencies for the API client library generation and the Mastercard OAuth1 Signer library.
   Mastercard offers OAuth1 Signer Libraries which offer code helpers targeting the HTTP clients used by the different OpenAPI Generator Library templates. The libraries are hosted here on [Github](https://github.com/Mastercard?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=oauth1-signer&type=&language=).

When using OpenAPI Generator to generate the API client library, you have two options:

* Generate and use the source files on the fly
* Generate and deploy the source files to a Maven repository In this tutorial, you will be generating the API client library on the fly, so you include the dependencies that are needed to generate the library. (If you were deploying the source files to a Maven repository, you would only need to include the dependency for that repository.)

## Step 2: Generating the API Client SDK {#step-2-generating-the-api-client-sdk}

### a) Generate Sources {#a-generate-sources}

Now that you have all the dependencies you need, you can generate the sources.

In IntelliJ IDEA, open the window for Maven (View \> Tool Windows \> Maven).
Click the icons for Reimport All Maven Projects and Generate Sources and Update Folders for All Projects:

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_api_tutorial_generate_sources1.png)

### b) Generate the SDK {#b-generate-the-sdk}

You should now be ready to generate the API client library.

In the same menu, navigate to the commands ({Project name} \> Lifecycle), run clean and then compile. Alternatively, you can navigate to the root directory of the project within a terminal window and run mvn clean compile.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/xb_api_tutorial_generate_sources2.png)

Next, there should be a new folder named target, within your root directory, which contains classes generated for the schemas and API calls defined within the OpenAPI Specification. The generated classes can be found in target folder as shown below.

![](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/documentation/images/tutorial_target_folder.png)

## Step 3: Making API Call (with encrypted payload) {#step-3-making-api-call-with-encrypted-payload}

Make sure you have below dependency added to your pom.xml file for Encryption.

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.mastercard.developer</groupId>
            <artifactId>client-encryption</artifactId>
            <version>1.6.0</version>
        </dependency>

Create a Java file, called Main.java, at src/main/java/.

To make an API call with encrypted payload, you need to make your OAuth credentials and Encryption keys available to the program to use:
* Oauth

```Oauth
String consumerKey = "your consumer key";
String signingKeyFilePath = "/path/to/your/key.p12";
String signingKeyAlias = "your key alias";
String signingKeyPassword = "your password";
PrivateKey signingKey = AuthenticationUtils.loadSigningKey(signingKeyFilePath, signingKeyAlias, signingKeyPassword);
String decryptionKeyFilePath = "/path/to/your/key.p12";
String decryptionKeyAlias = "your decryption key alias";
String decryptionKeyPassword = "your decryption password";
PrivateKey decryptionKey = EncryptionUtils.loadDecryptionKey(decryptionKeyFilePath, decryptionKeyAlias, decryptionKeyPassword)
String encryptionCertPath = "/path/to/your/CrossBorderServicesEnc.pem";
```

Next, you instantiate a client that you can set up to sign requests that you send with your authentication credentials.
* Client_Instantiation

```Client_Instantiation
ApiClient client = new ApiClient();
client.setBasePath("https://sandbox.api.mastercard.com");
client.setDebugging(true);
client.setReadTimeout(40000);
List<Interceptor> interceptors = client.getHttpClient().interceptors();
interceptors.add(new ForceJsonResponseInterceptor());
client.addDefaultHeader("x-encrypted","true"); // This header should be added for all Encryption calls.

JweConfig config = JweConfigBuilder.aJweEncryptionConfig()
            .withEncryptionCertificate(EncryptionUtils.
                    loadEncryptionCertificate(encryptionCertPath))
            .withEncryptionPath("$", "$.encrypted_payload") // This property should be kept as it is.
            .withEncryptedValueFieldName("data") // This property should be kept as it is.
            .withDecryptionKey(decryptionKey)
            .withDecryptionPath("$.encrypted_payload.data", "$") // This property should be kept as it is.
            .build();
interceptors.add(OkHttp2JweInterceptor.from(config)); // This interceptor should be added before OAuth Interceptor.
interceptors.add(new OkHttp2OAuth1Interceptor(consumerKey, signingKey));
HttpLoggingInterceptor logger = new HttpLoggingInterceptor();
logger.setLevel(HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY);
interceptors.add(logger);
PaymentApi paymentApi = new PaymentApi(client);  
```

The interceptor that you use to sign requests is also provided by the Mastercard OAuth library.
* Interceptor

```Interceptor
private static class ForceJsonResponseInterceptor implements Interceptor {
        @Override
        public Response intercept(Chain chain) throws IOException {
            Request originalRequest = chain.request();
            String withJsonFormatUrl = withJsonFormat(originalRequest.uri().toString());
            Request newRequest = originalRequest.newBuilder().url(withJsonFormatUrl).build();
            return chain.proceed(newRequest);
        }

        private String withJsonFormat(String uri) {
            StringBuilder newUri = new StringBuilder(uri);
            newUri.append(uri.contains("?") ? "&" : "?");
            newUri.append("Format=JSON");
            return newUri.toString();
        }
    }

```

With your environment set up, you can start to build a request.
Any nested objects within the Request Body have each been assigned a wrapper class, and so in order to build the request, you will be instantiating multiple objects and ultimately wrapping those with the main request object.
You make the Encrypted API call, parse the response payload and store it into a Response object.
Once you have the response stored, you have different options, but for this tutorial you can simply use toString to print the response body.  

To make it easy to understand, only the snippets needed to make the API call is shown above. The full content of Main.java is shown below.

In this case, the value in this field will represent the card rate ID associated to the rate used on the payment.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 831             | Expired Rate Indicator       | This field will only be provided on Payment responses when an OI has opted in for Carded Rates and is configured for "Expired Rate" processing. Indicator telling whether the value provided in the card_rate_id field of the payment request was honored or expired. This also indicates if the settlement amount in the payment response was recalculated as part of Expired Rates processing or not. This indicator is used in conjunction with the Rate ID field (830) defined above. Valid Values: **RATE_HONORED** : The rate ID from the card_rate_id field of the payment request was still valid when the payment was processed and was honored (used for payment processing). **RATE_EXPIRED**: The rate Id from the card_rate_id field of the payment request was no longer valid when the payment was processed and a new FX rate has been applied. The new FX rate created a new settlement amount for the payment that was processed.                                                     |
| 840             | Quote ID                     | This field will only be provided on Quote and Payment responses when an OI is configured for "Expired Quote" processing. This is a "Quote ID" provided for each quote and payment response as part of expired quote processing. This value can be used by an OI if they need to have a unique value for backend processing or trading associated to each transaction. This field is used in conjunction with Expired Quote Indicator field (841) described below. When Additional Data 841 = **QUOTE_HONORED** , the value in the Quote ID field will be the same in the Quote and Payment response. When Additional Data 841 = **QUOTE_EXPIRED** , the value in the Quote ID field of the payment response will be different than the value provided in the Quote response. When there is a new (different) value provided in the payment response, the OI may use this new value in any backend process required to support the new settlement amount calculated as part of expired quote processing. |
| 841             | Expired Quote Indicator      | This field will only be provided on Payment responses when an OI is configured for "Expired Quote" processing. Indicator telling whether the proposal in the Quote used on the payment was honored or expired. This also indicates if the settlement amount in the payment response was recalculated as part of Expired Quote processing or not. This field is used in conjunction with Quote ID field (840) described above. Valid Values: **QUOTE_HONORED** : The rate from the proposal in the Quote was still valid when the payment was processed and was honored (used for payment processing). **QUOTE_EXPIRED**: The rate from the proposal in the Quote was no longer valid when the payment was processed and a new FX rate has been applied. The new FX rate created a new settlement amount for the payment that was processed.                                                                                                                                                             |

# Address Validation API
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/address-validation-api/index.md

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information. Alert: If you are an Originating Institution contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, please proceed to [Address Validation API Specifications for EU](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-eu-address-validation-api/index.md) and [Address Validation API Specification for UK](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/psd2-uk-address-validation-api/index.md) respectively to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

The Address Validation Service is an optional service which customers can use to confirm the validity of an address before sending a transaction to Mastercard Cross-Border Services.

Address validations with successful responses will return country specific address structure to be used for transactions.

List of supported countries will be maintained and activated for Mastercard Cross-Border Services. Mastercard Cross-Border Services will activate the usable countries. If the country is not in the usable list, any requests for that country will be rejected. The first country activated is United States.

## Environment Domains {#environment-domains}

* Sandbox
* Production

```Sandbox
https://sandbox.api.mastercard.com/send/address-validation-service/addresses/validations
```

```Production
https://api.mastercard.com/send/address-validation-service/addresses/validations
```

## API {#api}

[**Open Specification**](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/address_validation_service_swagger.yaml)

API Reference: `GET /send/address-validation-service/addresses/validations`

* **Formats supported** : JSON   
* **HTTP Version**: 1.0/ 1.1
* **Required HTTP header parameters** :   
  content-type : Format of the inbound content being submitted. example: application/json   
  accept: Format of the inbound content being submitted. example: application/json   
  X-Mc-Correlation-Id : A unique correlation ID for tracking the request.   
  Partner-Ref-Id : A unique reference ID of the business partner.

## API Convention {#api-convention}

Take a look at the [API Conventions](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-conventions/index.md) for general guidelines.

## Payload Encryption {#payload-encryption}

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the payload sent by Mastercard.   

For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)

## Sandbox Testing {#sandbox-testing}

You can make API calls to the Sandbox server from your application code using the [tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md), which involves creating a Mastercard Developers project and using the Sandbox keys to generate the required OAuth 1.0a Authorization Header.
Tip: During the onboarding process, Mastercard will assign a registered partner ID to test in the higher environments (MTF Test and Production). This partner ID will not be able to access the sandbox environment, but the customer can still access sandbox by using the non-registered partner ID.   
Any correctly formatted partner ID can be used in the sandbox. As a best practice, use the first 15 digits of your institution's name (alphanumeric and/or special characters, no spaces) as the Partner_ID.   
For testing in sandbox, please use unique transaction_reference on each run. Note: The sandbox does not return parameters unique to originating institutions; such as pricing, limits, and corridor-specific data requirements, but allows you to test general call structure and responses outside of the production environment. After sandbox testing is completed, customers meeting the eligibility requirements will be assigned a project manager to do integrated testing in the test environment that has been configured to include requested receiving corridors, current foreign exchange rates, and fixed and variable fees specific to the Originating Institution.

### Sandbox Test cases {#sandbox-test-cases}

Alert: For the Address Validation Service all requests initiated in the Sandbox/MTF url must use the test cases specified in the following table. Please limit your testing requirements only to test cases available below.

The Sandbox server returns simulated, static responses. You can use the following test cases to produce specific responses.

### Business can view transaction history and track payment status {#business-can-view-transaction-history-and-track-payment-status}

Once a business begins making money transfers, it may wish to monitor the transaction history and check payment statuses. The transaction history is conveniently accessible in the 'Activity' section, organized chronologically for easy reference.

For a more detailed view, business users can tap on any specific transaction to access comprehensive information such as its current status, transfer details, and recipient information.

# Transfer money to a digital wallet
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/experience-design-guide/person-to-person-transfers/transfer-money-to-digital-wallet/index.md

The user sends money internationally to a new recipient's digital wallet (payment with Quote)
In this journey, the sender makes a cross-border payment to a new recipient's GCash wallet through a money transfer app. The sender selects the new recipient's country and 'Digital wallet' as the endpoint.

After specifying the amount, the sender reviews the exchange rate and total payment due. Importantly, they have the flexibility to determine who covers the fee, according to their preference. Following this, the sender selects the preferred funding account and inputs the recipient's personal details, selects GCash from the list of supported digital wallets and enters the wallet details. If required by country regulations, the sender enters any additional information mandated. Prior to finalizing the transaction, the sender thoroughly reviews the payment details and the transfer concludes successfully.

# Disburse money to an existing recipient
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/experience-design-guide/business-to-person-transfers/disburse-money-to-existing-recipient/index.md

### Business sends money internationally to an existing recipient (payment with Quote) {#business-sends-money-internationally-to-an-existing-recipient-payment-with-quote}

This journey shows how a user can transfer money to a saved contact, without having to manually enter the recipient details. Although recipient management is not a capability offered by the Cross-Border Services APIs, it is recommended that the OI builds this capability to streamline the money transfer process.

For instance, the business makes a cross-border payment to an existing recipient through a money transfer app. Having previously sent money to the recipient, all details are saved in the recipient list. This allows the business to easily initiate subsequent payments to the recipient without re-entering their information each time.

After specifying the amount to send, the business views the exchange rate and total amount due. If applicable, it sets the preferred fee option before selecting a funding account and carefully reviewing all payment details. Once satisfied, the business confirms the transfer, successfully concluding the transaction.

# Testing plan
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/experience-design-guide/prepare-for-launch/testing-plan/index.md

### Why test? {#why-test}

Usability testing, or user testing, helps you evaluate your product or service with actual users. You can use their feedback to create an even better consumer product.

<br />


Throughout the testing process, you can explore and analyze your target audience's behavior as they interact with your product.
![Why test?](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/whytest.png)

### Testing plan {#testing-plan}

The following behaviors should be tested with the Cross-Border Services experience:
Tip: The testing should be conducted with a minimum of 10 consumers in either a moderated or unmoderated setting.

##### In testing, we are looking for answers to the following questions: {#in-testing-we-are-looking-for-answers-to-the-following-questions}

* Are users able to complete key tasks such as making payments, tracking payments, viewing transaction history and managing recipients?
* Are users able to understand how the process of making cross-border payments works?
* Are users able to navigate multiple steps seamlessly and understand the task at hand?
* Do users find the language easy to understand?
* Are users able to find the key information like the exchange rate, fees, transfer speed and total they need to pay?
* Are users able to understand how the FX rates are calculated and applied to the transfer?
* Are users able to understand how the amount they pay and the amount the recipient gets is calculated?
* Are users able to understand how the recipient is created? Were there any fields or requirements that were unclear?
* Do users find the process of managing and saving recipient information intuitive and secure?
* Do users find the visual design of the experience to be clean and easy to understand?
* Do users feel that the experience provides them with the transparency and flexibility that they expect?
* Do users find the experience safe and trustworthy?
* Do users prefer using this product over other similar products?
![Questions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/questions.png)
Tip: As a guide, if **70%** or more of your users respond positively to each of the above questions, then you have created a great UX for Cross-Border Services!

For a more detailed view, consumers can tap on any specific transaction to access comprehensive information such as its current status, transfer details, and recipient information. Consumers also have the flexibility to track their transactions from multiple entry points within the money transfer app. Upon initiating a transaction, consumers can opt to use the 'Track' call-to-action button displayed on the success screen. Alternatively, for transactions in progress, a convenient bottom-sheet is docked on the dashboard, providing real-time updates and allowing users to easily monitor the transaction's progress.

# Update Request API
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/update-request-api/index.md

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information. Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, please proceed to [Update Request API Specifications for EU](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-eu-update-request-api/index.md) and [Update Request API Specification for UK](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-uk-update-request-api/index.md) respectively to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based on Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

## API {#api}

[**++Open Specification++**](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/RFI+Spec.yaml)

This API will be used by a Customer to provide a response to a RFI request assigned to the Customer. Look at the RFI process description [How it works](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/how-it-works/index.md) for details on how to use the Update Request API for a cross border RFI solution.


API Reference: `POST /send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/rfi/requests/{request_id}`

* **Formats supported** : JSON   
* **HTTP Version**: 1.0/ 1.1
* **Required HTTP header parameters** :   
  content-type : Format of the inbound content being submitted. example: application/ json   
  content-length: Length of the inbound content body in octets.   
  Accept: Format of the expected response must be provided in this header field. Example- application/json

## Environment Domains {#environment-domains}

* Sandbox/MTF
* Production

```Sandbox/MTF
https://sandbox.api.mastercard.com/send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/rfi/requests/{request_id} 
```

```Production
 https://api.mastercard.com/send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/rfi/requests/{request_id}
```

## API Convention {#api-convention}

Take a look at the [API Conventions](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-conventions/index.md) for general guidelines.

## Payload Encryption {#payload-encryption}

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the payload sent by  
Mastercard.   

For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)

## Sandbox Testing {#sandbox-testing}

You can make API calls to the Sandbox server from your application code using the [tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md), which involves creating a Mastercard Developers project and using the Sandbox keys to generate the required OAuth 1.0a Authorization Header.
Tip: During the onboarding process, Mastercard will assign a registered partner ID to test in the higher environments (MTF Test and Production). This partner ID will not be able to access the sandbox environment, but the customer can still access sandbox by using the non-registered partner ID.   
Any correctly formatted partner ID can be used in the sandbox. As a best practice, use the first 15 digits of your institution's name (alphanumeric and/or special characters, no spaces) as the Partner_ID.   
For testing in sandbox, please use unique transaction_reference on each run. Note: The sandbox does not return parameters unique to a specific Customer; such as pricing, limits, and corridor-specific data requirements, but allows you to test general call structure and responses outside of the production environment. After sandbox testing is completed, Customers meeting the eligibility requirements will be assigned a project manager to do integrated testing in the test environment that has been configured to include requested receiving corridors, current foreign exchange rates, and fixed and variable fees specific to the Customer.

# Upload Document API
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/upload-document-api/index.md

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information. Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, please proceed to [Upload Document API Specifications for EU](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-eu-upload-document-api/index.md) and [Upload Document API Specification for UK](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-uk-upload-document-api/index.md) respectively to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based on Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

## Environment Domains {#environment-domains}

* Sandbox/MTF
* Production

```Sandbox/MTF
https://sandbox.api.mastercard.com/send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/rfi/documents
```

```Production
https://api.mastercard.com/send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/rfi/documents
```

## API {#api}

[**++Open Specification++**](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/RFI+Spec.yaml)

This API will be used by the Customer to upload a document to the MC system. Look at the RFI process description [How it works](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/how-it-works/index.md) for details on how to use the Upload Document API for a cross border RFI solution.

API Reference: `GET /send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/rfi/documents`

* **Formats supported** : JSON   
* **HTTP Version**: 1.0/ 1.1
* **Required HTTP header parameters** :   
  content-type : Format of the inbound content being submitted. example: application/ json   
  content-length: Length of the inbound content body in octets.   
  Accept: Format of the expected response must be provided in this header field. Example- application/json

## API Convention {#api-convention}

Take a look at the [API Conventions](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-conventions/index.md) for general guidelines.

## Payload Encryption {#payload-encryption}

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the payload sent by  
Mastercard.   

For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)

## Sandbox Testing {#sandbox-testing}

You can make API calls to the Sandbox server from your application code using the [tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md), which involves creating a Mastercard Developers project and using the Sandbox keys to generate the required OAuth 1.0a Authorization Header.
Tip: During the onboarding process, Mastercard will assign a registered partner ID to test in the higher environments (MTF Test and Production). This partner ID will not be able to access the sandbox environment, but the customer can still access sandbox by using the non-registered partner ID.   
Any correctly formatted partner ID can be used in the sandbox. As a best practice, use the first 15 digits of your institution's name (alphanumeric and/or special characters, no spaces) as the Partner_ID.   
For testing in sandbox, please use unique transaction_reference on each run. Note: The sandbox does not return parameters unique to a specific Customer; such as pricing, limits, and corridor-specific data requirements, but allows you to test general call structure and responses outside of the production environment. After sandbox testing is completed, Customers meeting the eligibility requirements will be assigned a project manager to do integrated testing in the test environment that has been configured to include requested receiving corridors, current foreign exchange rates, and fixed and variable fees specific to the Customer.

# Disburse money to a bank account
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/experience-design-guide/business-to-person-transfers/disburse-money-to-bank-account/index.md

### Business sends money internationally to an individual's bank account (payment with Quote) {#business-sends-money-internationally-to-an-individuals-bank-account-payment-with-quote}

In this journey, the business makes a cross-border payment to the recipient's bank account through a money transfer web app. They select the new recipient's country and 'Bank account' as the endpoint.

Following this, the business enters the recipient's personal and bank account details. Next, they specify the amount, select the preferred funding account, and review the exchange rate and total payment due. Importantly, they have the flexibility to determine who covers the fee, according to their preference. Prior to finalizing the transaction, they thoroughly review the payment details. Once satisfied, the business confirms the transfer, successfully concluding the transaction.

# Payment with Carded Rate
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/experience-design-guide/person-to-person-transfers/payment-with-carded-rate/index.md

### The user sends money internationally to a new recipient's bank account (payment with Carded Rate) {#the-user-sends-money-internationally-to-a-new-recipients-bank-account-payment-with-carded-rate}

In this journey, the sender makes a cross-border payment to the recipient's bank account through a money transfer app. The sender selects the new recipient's country and 'Bank account' as the endpoint.

Since the OI has opted for carded rates, when the sender specifies the amount they wish to send, they are shown the exchange rate and total payment due in real time. If applicable, they have the flexibility to determine who covers the fee, according to their preference. Following this, the sender selects the preferred funding account and inputs the recipient's personal and bank account details. Prior to finalizing the transaction, the sender thoroughly reviews the payment details and the transfer concludes successfully.

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the payload sent by  
Mastercard.   

For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)

## Sandbox Testing {#sandbox-testing}

You can make API calls to the Sandbox server from your application code using the [tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md), which involves creating a Mastercard Developers project and using the Sandbox keys to generate the required OAuth 1.0a Authorization Header.
Tip: During the onboarding process, Mastercard will assign a registered partner ID to test in the higher environments (MTF Test and Production). This partner ID will not be able to access the sandbox environment, but the customer can still access sandbox by using the non-registered partner ID.   
Any correctly formatted partner ID can be used in the sandbox. As a best practice, use the first 15 digits of your institution's name (alphanumeric and/or special characters, no spaces) as the Partner_ID.   
For testing in sandbox, please use unique transaction_reference on each run. Note: The sandbox does not return parameters unique to a specific Customer; such as pricing, limits, and corridor-specific data requirements, but allows you to test general call structure and responses outside of the production environment. After sandbox testing is completed, Customers meeting the eligibility requirements will be assigned a project manager to do integrated testing in the test environment that has been configured to include requested receiving corridors, current foreign exchange rates, and fixed and variable fees specific to the Customer.

# Manage recipients

### Business can add, delete, or edit recipient details {#business-can-add-delete-or-edit-recipient-details}

A well-designed money transfer experience empowers consumers to efficiently manage their recipients, ensuring accuracy and convenience. The money transfer app must have a dedicated space specifically designed to store and display the recipient list prominently. Here, business users can effortlessly add new recipient details, eliminating the need for repetitive manual entries with each new payment.

Furthermore, the experience must provide intuitive options to edit recipient information whenever updates are necessary, such as changes in contact details or account information. Business users can easily navigate to the recipient list, select the specific recipient to modify, and seamlessly update the details by tapping on the 'Edit' call-to-action. Additionally, businesses must be given the flexibility to delete recipients from the list when they are no longer relevant, ensuring that outdated information is removed.

# Payment without Quote
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/experience-design-guide/business-to-person-transfers/payment-without-quote/index.md

### Business sends money internationally to a new recipient's bank account (payment without Quote) {#business-sends-money-internationally-to-a-new-recipients-bank-account-payment-without-quote}

Cross-Border Services support money transfers even if the OI has not opted to use the Quote API. In this case, the user sees the exchange rates after the transfer has been initiated.

The business, for instance, makes a cross-border payment to a new recipient through a money transfer app. Since the money transfer app does not use the Quote API to display exchange rates upfront, the business proceeds without a quote. To begin the transfer, the business opts to pay a new recipient and selects 'Bank account' as the endpoint for the transfer. The business then enters the recipient's personal and bank account details before entering the amount that it wishes to send, specifying either its own currency or the recipient's, depending on its preference. If applicable, the business selects its preferred fee option at this stage and the chosen funding account. Before finalizing the transaction, the business thoroughly reviews all payment details to ensure accuracy and completeness. Following the completion of the transfer, the app provides the business with comprehensive details including the exchange rate used, the total amount paid, and the exact amount that will be received by the recipient.

# Disburse money to a digital wallet

### Business sends money internationally to an individual's digital wallet (payment with Quote) {#business-sends-money-internationally-to-an-individuals-digital-wallet-payment-with-quote}

In this journey, the business makes a cross-border payment to the recipient's digital wallet through a money transfer web app. They select the new recipient's country and 'Digital wallet' as the endpoint.

Following this, the business selects GCash from the list of supported digital wallets, enters the recipient's wallet number and their personal details. Next, they specify the amount, select the preferred funding account, and review the exchange rate and total payment due. Importantly, they have the flexibility to determine who covers the fee, according to their preference. If required by country regulations, the sender enters any additional information mandated. Prior to finalizing the transaction, they thoroughly review the payment details. Once satisfied, the business confirms the transfer, successfully concluding the transaction.

# Transfer money to an existing recipient
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/experience-design-guide/person-to-person-transfers/transfer-money-to-existing-recipient/index.md

### User sends money internationally to an existing recipient (payment with Quote) {#user-sends-money-internationally-to-an-existing-recipient-payment-with-quote}

This journey shows how a user can transfer money to a saved contact, without having to manually enter the recipient details. Although recipient management is not a capability offered by the Cross-Border Services APIs, it is recommended that the OI builds this capability to streamline the money transfer process.

For instance, the sender makes a cross-border payment to an existing recipient through a money transfer app. Having previously sent money to the recipient, all details are saved in the recipient list. This allows the sender to easily initiate subsequent payments to the recipient without re-entering their information each time.

After specifying the amount to send, the sender views the exchange rate and total amount due. If applicable, they set their preferred fee option before selecting their funding account and carefully reviewing all payment details. Once satisfied, the sender confirms the transfer, successfully concluding the transaction.

### Business sends money internationally to a new recipient's bank account (payment with Carded Rate) {#business-sends-money-internationally-to-a-new-recipients-bank-account-payment-with-carded-rate}

In this journey, the business makes a cross-border payment to the recipient's bank account through a money transfer app. The business selects the new recipient's country and 'Bank account' as the endpoint.

Since the OI has opted for carded rates, when the business specifies the amount it wishes to send, it is shown the exchange rate and total payment due in real time. If applicable, it has the flexibility to determine who covers the fee, according to its preference. Following this, the business selects the preferred funding account and inputs the recipient's personal and bank account details. Prior to finalizing the transaction, the business thoroughly reviews the payment details and the transfer concludes successfully.

# Retrieve Request API 
source: https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/retrieve-request-api/index.md

Alert: Mastercard will be migrating from Entrust to DigiCert CA certificates, in response to the announcement made by Google and Mozilla to move away from Entrust CA. You are required to switch to DigiCert CA before March 10, 2025 in production to ensure a successful SSL handshake and avoid any service disruption. Please refer to the communication and [instructions](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/uploads/Instructions.pdf) sent to your organization dated February 11, 2025 for more information. Alert: If you are a Customer contracted with MTS EU or MTS UK, please proceed to [Retrieve Request API Specifications for EU](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-eu-retrieve-request-api/index.md) and [Retrieve Request API Specification for UK](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/rfi-apis/psd2-uk-retrieve-request-api/index.md) respectively to ensure compliance with the relevant jurisdiction based on Regulatory Technical Standards (either EU or UK) derived from the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

## Environment Domains {#environment-domains}

* Sandbox/MTF
* Production

```Sandbox/MTF
https://sandbox.api.mastercard.com/send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/rfi/requests/{request_id} 
```

```Production
https://api.mastercard.com/send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/rfi/requests/{request_id}
```

## API {#api}

[**Open Specification**](https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/cross-border-services/swagger/RFI+Spec.yaml)

This API will be used to retrieve the latest information of a RFI request. The response provides the latest status of the request, information requested of the Customer, response provided by the Customer (when available) and the review status for each field (when available).

API Reference: `GET /send/partners/{partner_id}/crossborder/rfi/requests/{request_id}`

* **Formats supported** : JSON   
* **HTTP Version**: 1.0/ 1.1
* **Required HTTP header parameters** :   
  content-type : Format of the inbound content being submitted. example: application/ json   
  content-length: Length of the inbound content body in octets.   
  Accept: Format of the expected response must be provided in this header field. Example- application/json

## API Convention {#api-convention}

Take a look at the [API Conventions](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-basics/api-conventions/index.md) for general guidelines.

## Payload Encryption {#payload-encryption}

All the request payload sent by you to Mastercard must be encrypted. And you will need to decrypt the payload sent by  
Mastercard.   

For more detailed information on payload **Encryption/ Decryption** , please see [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/api-ref/encryption/index.md)

## Sandbox Testing {#sandbox-testing}

You can make API calls to the Sandbox server from your application code using the [tutorials](https://developer.mastercard.com/cross-border-services/documentation/tutorials/index.md), which involves creating a Mastercard Developers project and using the Sandbox keys to generate the required OAuth 1.0a Authorization Header.
Tip: During the onboarding process, Mastercard will assign a registered partner ID to test in the higher environments (MTF Test and Production). This partner ID will not be able to access the sandbox environment, but the customer can still access sandbox by using the non-registered partner ID.   
Any correctly formatted partner ID can be used in the sandbox. As a best practice, use the first 15 digits of your institution's name (alphanumeric and/or special characters, no spaces) as the Partner_ID.   
For testing in sandbox, please use unique transaction_reference on each run. Note: The sandbox does not return parameters unique to a specific Customer; such as pricing, limits, and corridor-specific data requirements, but allows you to test general call structure and responses outside of the production environment. After sandbox testing is completed, Customers meeting the eligibility requirements will be assigned a project manager to do integrated testing in the test environment that has been configured to include requested receiving corridors, current foreign exchange rates, and fixed and variable fees specific to the Customer.
